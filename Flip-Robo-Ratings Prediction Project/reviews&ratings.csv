64,Amazing value for money and HP Trust,"This laptop never fails to amuse me! It has an amazing AMD Ryzen 5500U processor with 6 cores and 12 threads coupled with an AMD Radeon Vega 7 (if I am not wrong) both the processor and GPU share the system memory, but that's ok. 8 GB RAM at 3200 MHz is superfast. 512 GB SSD, so the read and write speed is fast. I use this laptop for computer graphics, photo editing, video editing, web designing using WordPress and MS Office and it works like a charm. I have edited 4K videos using this laptop and the processor just zooms past and completes the rendering within minutes. There is no lag even, when I am scrubbing the videos. The keyboard is butter smooth. The touch pad is smooth like an ice skating rink. The laptop comes with HP additional software which makes setting it up very easy. Fast charging battery. Backup is 4 to 6 hours depending on your usage.

186,"Bad Design, Substandard Keyboard, dont buy this or any of its variant model laptops!!!","My Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop is still in warranty and since Dec 2020 has had two keyboard replacements. One or more keys stop working within an year. After the first replacement during manufacturers warranty, I decided to extend my warranty for another year and that has saved me from a big expense.<br><br>The worst part is the keyboard is not a replaceable component on its own. The keyboard is part of an assembly that includes the touchpad, speakers and the top frame on which one rests one hand while typing, see pics for details. Besides the design of the hand rest where there is a drop in the hand rest where the trackpad ends and the keyboard begins is faulty, this drop touches and rubs against the screen when the laptop is shut and screen is folded down as one would normally carry or store the laptop.<br><br>without extended warranty this laptop is unaffordable as Lenovo will replace the whole assembly comprising of speakers &amp; trackpad if the keyboard malfunctions, which has now happened twice with me, each time a new one was replaced.<br><br>If one has to replace a faulty keyboard at ones own cost, one will be billed for the replacement speakers as well as the trackpad which may be perfectly ok as was in my case, not once but twice.<br><br>I cannot even begin to understand why this is so, it must have come through in QA and testing, if any was done at all. This is unacceptable, never again will I buy any Lenovo laptops again, this is my first and last Lenovo laptop.<br><br>Have had DELL, Toshiba, Asus and HP laptops in the past, none was as worthless and troublesome as this one.

309,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings.

318,Good product,"&nbsp;I am writing this review after one month of usage, at first  i got the laptop with some warranty issue so i replaced it and after 10 to 15 days my touchpad was not responding in between and it's used to gets  stuck so i called Lenovo customer care and till one week they were updating my driver's and then at last reinstalling windows also didn't solve the issue so now they are replacing the toucpad, hope so it will solve the issue.And regarding screen quality it's really not good but for normal users it does the job , please carefully see the upgradability ,for  ram it is  only 12gb which is quite less , as 16gb normally all laptop's offers. Battery backup is good. Please check each and  every thing within 7 day's as you can get replacement or return within that period bcoz it's better  than replacing parts in new laptops.

354,Quick Review,"If you are a first-time buyer TN panel won't look bad but don't downgrade it's not worth it. Or just go for the 14-inch variant which has an IPS display. Another thing is it doesn't have dedicated graphics so it takes memory from the RAM so you get around 5 GBS of RAM free. 15.6 variant doesn't have a fingerprint reader only 14'inch has that, the performance of this machine is satisfying.",4.0 out of 5 stars

490,Good for work purpose,"Laptop looks stylish and looks premium however only time will tell how the built quality is. Serves my work related purpose. Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor.<br>Pro:-<br>1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top)<br>2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc.<br>3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear.<br>4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure)<br>5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity<br>6. Browsing speed is also very good<br><br>Con:-<br>1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected.<br>2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years)<br>3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time.<br>4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.<br><br>Can't say:<br>1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later<br>2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usage<br><br>Edit:<br>1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work<br>2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings. You won't get graphics but game runs smoothly.<br>3) Has heating issues even after running excel and tally prime",4.0 out of 5 stars

I use my laptop most of the time plugged in. And this laptop is a headache for me . It charges 100 % every time and after 95% it starts charging again , if you contact themto get a solution , they will not provide any software or BIOS update for you . I know lot of you can't understand what's the benefit of charging lock system but when you use your laptop you can definitely feel this problem, you can't save your battery for long time , your laptop battery will die in a short period of time than the the other brands laptop will remain healthy if the activites this system",4.0 out of 5 stars

You can watch movies, play most games at reduced graphics settings, read ebooks for long,  video and photo editing.  It doesn't come with a dedicated graphics card, so if you are looking something for AutoCAD, don't go for it.<br><br>Excellent Laptop. Great Finish and built quality. Boots in seconds. Screen resolution is very good and great viewing angles with awesome silver colour. If you want something from HP, please see one similar laptop from HP here .. it costs whooping 59k and this Lenovo laptop is price at 49k. So thumps up to Lenovo.<br><br>Pros:<br>1)The build of laptop is excellent with premium built quality. It feels very slim and light weight on daily usage.<br>2) Booting speed is great (2-3 second) and SSD works very fast.<br>3) The keyboard is a decent one for a laptop .<br>4) Touchpad is awsome and responsive with windows 10 gestures. Fingerprint is pretty good at its job.<br>5) Display quality is very good at this price range. Even at bright sunlight you can view the display effectively.<br>6) Batter backup is 5 - 6 hours at average usage.<br>7) Speaker are awesome and webcam is average but its better than expected.<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Sound is too crispy for my liking but most won't notice it.<br>2) Design is not that attractive.<br><br>No heating issue observed while normal browsing or typing.

688,Harrowing experience,"&nbsp;Disclaimers:<br>1. My review is based on the rough 3 weeks for which I used it. Post that, I returned the product.<br>2. This review is not to be construed to mean that all products in this line are necessarily bad. It could be the case that only I had a bad experience.<br><br>I will state the cons first as they far outweigh the pros.<br>Cons:<br>A. The primary and probably the biggest con for me (which resulted in me returning the product )  was that the display would flicker at intervals (From Day 1 of using the product). Sometimes the flickering wouldn't persist for long  and would occur only for a few seconds. At other times, it would just go on and on, making work impossible and having to re-install the display driver to make it stop. I'd be using it mostly for work (Microsoft office and Adobe) and otherwise, to watch videos and movies. At an average, I'd have to reset (uninstall and reinstall) the Display Driver once every day. Never got around to gaming with it owing to the display flickering problem, as it  used to get quite irritating. (Refer to my video to understand the problem of flickering)<br><br>B. The speaker quality is very average.  The highest volume doesn't produce sound audible enough. So for music, movies etc. , you'd have to use speakers or earphones/headphones.<br><br>C. Acer support  is not upto the mark. After raising my complaint with them and despite the fact that it was a brand new product , they did little to assuage my concerns. They refused to send anyone to pick up my product and said I'd have to get in touch with one of their service centres and personally go there to deliver it. Neither did they give any assurance on a timeline within which they would be able to resolve my problem, nor did they offer a temporary laptop to use while this one got fixed (this was a real problem as I need a functional  laptop at any given point in time and I had also explained my situation to them).<br><br>D. The charger input slot is such that you have to insert the charger at a certain angle; otherwise it's difficult to insert. And to get that angle right is quite difficult. I would keep it plugged in and operate it by switching on and off the main switch (like a Desktop PC).<br><br>E. Battery life is not too good. I wasn't even doing any heavy work or gaming and the battery would last for hardly 4-4.5 hours before reaching 20% from full charge.<br><br>Pros:<br>A. Amazon support was pretty good as compared to dismal Acer support. They arranged for a technician to come and  inspect the problem I had complained of. Amazon does not have a return and refund policy for electronic items and only a replacement policy in case of defective goods. Thereafter , after the technican uploaded his report, I was assured that I would get a replacement of the defective product with a brand new product. However, as it turned out, the seller had exhausted his stock of the product with no idea on when he'd be able to procure new stock. So all in all, I stood to get a full refund after a return was arranged. Just returned the product and am awaiting my refund to reflect in my account.<br><br>B. The fans are placed stategically such that it does not heat up while working. This is particularly good for heavy gaming.<br><br>C. The display resolution is pretty good (my flickering issue aside).<br><br>D. Machine performance is really fast.<br><br>E. Looks stylish.<br><br>To conclude, my advice would be to purchase from an authorised store (whatever laptop you're purchasing, irrespective of the make) after physical verification. It's better that way.  Prices may be cheaper online, but you get quality assurance through physical purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars
689,Dissapointed with the hardware,"This is a review after 1.5 yrs. Disappointed with the overall performance, SSD and HDD seem to have issue as the laptop freezes and crashes frequently which is rare for a new laptop.

So They replaced the SSD and the issue was resolved in one week. Then after two days of usage, the laptop failed again, and again started giving an error of ""No Bootable Device"". Then again I called up support and this time they changed the MOTHERBOAD. Then after one day of usage the charger stopped working.  So again I called up the support and told them this product is complete failure and please give me a replacement. This has been going for one month now. And my work has severely affected. Now when I mailed the support for the replacement of the product because it's just a train of failures in this product, they replied me that I'm on my own and they only can give me services and not a replacement and clearly this is a defected product.

Actually the whole story is I brought in an exchange offer and there was nothing to mention about the damage details of previous one .

754,Probably the best budget gaming laptop in India currently.,"I felt that the Acer Nitro 5 2019 model would lack in a lot of important spheres, mostly pertaining to music production (I use FL Studio very often with plugins which take a huge toll on the CPU), as well as gaming. But, I have not been disappointed at all.<br><br>PROS:<br>A) The CPU is amazing. As I write this review, I am aware of the fact that the Acer Nitro 5 2020 edition has been released with a stronger i5 10th generation processor, but for the people who think the 9th generation CPU lacks anywhere, you're clearly mistaken. The 10th generation is better, but there are no seismic differences between the 2 generations. No problems with any of the plugins in FL Studio and the CPU handles most recent titles, such as Death Stranding exceptionally well.<br>B) GTX 1650 is easily the best budget gaming GPU that you can get. Of course, the GTX 1650ti is also a formidable opponent, but I am having absolutely no issues with the GPU. The frames per second (FPS) I am getting on games like Death Stranding, Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs 2, Grand Theft Auto V, Tekken 7, etc. is more than enough.<br>C) The 8GB RAM is good, although you should definitely go for another 8GB stick. The more, the merrier :)<br>D) Many people have talked about screen bleeding issues. I personally don't have that problem. Although 60Hz on a panel of this laptop's caliber seems awkward, I don't have anything else to complain about when it comes to the display. The hertz can be overclocked to around 90Hz or so.<br>E) Keyboard feels good and responsive.<br>F) Battery backup is respectable.<br><br>CONS:<br>A) Don't even want to talk about the speakers.<br><br>Overall, for casual gaming, this laptop is amazing. I am having tons of fun with it, and for someone who upgraded from a stupid Geforce 920M GPU and an i3 4th generation CPU, this fulfills my need perfectly.<br>To quote a joke well known in the gaming community: 10/10, IGN!",5.0 out of 5 stars
755,"""Best Budget Gaming Laptop""","Writing review after almost using for 3 months.<br>Boot up is very quick.<br>It has many other features like NitroSense, Acer Network Optimiser and Acer Quick Access.<br>So these are value addition to the product.<br>Looks premium in design.<br>But not a metal body though as in case of Nitro 7 which is costlier.But it's absolutely fine.<br>Camera is average or enough and that's the case with all the laptops.So as such you can't complain about camera.<br>You get 930 GB of HDD and around 236 GB of SSD.But since Windows is installed on SSD so you get around 200 GB only.<br>Played games like GTA V, PUBG in ultra graphics settings and also installed softwares like Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Media Encoder.All work perfectly and no significant lags experienced.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Also the brightness level of the keyboard light can be adjusted with 4 different brightness levels.<br>So this is one more feature.<br>The dual cooling is also very effective.<br>The speakers are also great.<br>They are too good for a gaming laptop, a lot more than what I expected.<br>No issues with display as well.<br>You get a 1080 p screen which is normal.<br>Also what I liked a lot are the very THIN BEZELS.<br>So due to this, the screen looks a lot better.<br>So overall no issues experienced till now.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Only SSD can be added as it has one vacant SSD slot.<br>Will mostly add another 16 GB RAM and a half TB SSD, if not a TB to run it flawlessly for future.<br>Hope you find the review helpful !!😊😊",5.0 out of 5 stars
756,Performance is good obviously because it is new now let's see,"Received the laptop the next day itself after ordering. The packaging was not good, just a big box with the laptop box inside it. No visible damage though. The box contains a laptop and charger with some cool stickers along with a user manual (who reads that these days, lol) and a warranty card.<br><br>After using it for almost 2 years... It has stopped working... Not able to find what the issue is. Doesn't charge, doesn't power up. Stopped working suddenly in between gameplay due to overheating and won't work. I was using a cooling pad and power supply etc was fine. Sad to see such poor quality products.<br><br>After 3 days of testing, benchmarking and heavy usage:<br><br>Pros:<br>1. Game performance is good (GPU reaches 150 fps on extreme graphics)<br>2. Battery Backup good (around 4 hrs on normal usage)<br>3. Video editing and rendering is fast enough<br>4. Display quality is great<br>5. Dual fans with manual speed control<br><br>Cons:<br>1. Keyboard is not much responsive (misses some keystrokes when typing fast, not recommended for coders, very frustrating)<br>2. I have encountered complete freezing twice when browsing the internet in the last 3 days, but no freezing when gaming (yet)<br>3. The keyboard again, very frustrating when it misses keystrokes and i have to go back and correct it again.<br>4. WebCam is ok ok quality, did not like it very much.<br>5. The position of the touchpad to the left side and not the center is annoying (cant rest my wrists comfortably)",5.0 out of 5 stars
757,Amazing laptop for the price point,Perfect for gaming and other multimedia tasks. Superb feel. Worth the money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
758,Overall A Good Product,"I bought this on July 1st, 2020. Adding this review after one year of use.<br><br>Battery Backup: Overall good laptop with good battery backup. if using a remote desktop I get  8 hours backup. For normal use like chrome, music, movies I get approx 6 hours of backup.<br><br>Editing: up to 2k resolution video in the premiere pro is really smooth for editing. photoshop/Lightroom no issues with speed. But the screen color is not much good, it's an okay kind of thing. (In this price range it's really good)<br><br>Gaming: I am not a hardcore gamer, I played Forza Horizon 4 and GTA 5. I don't get any lagging issues.  Always plug in a charger and play.<br><br>Hardware: Overall good quality no issues till now. I like the keyboard it's nice, the trackpad is smooth compared with hp pavilion<br><br>Speaker: It's Okay not very good.<br><br>Screen: Good for watching movies and gaming, I won't suggest you if you are a professional video/photo editor.",5.0 out of 5 stars
759,Awesome!,"After a month of usage, all I have to say is this: this laptop is the budget king!<br><br>For this price, a powerful Core i5 processor, reasonably powerful GTX 1650 graphics card, 8 GB RAM (although I'd recommend an upgrade to 12/16 GB), fast PCIe SSD, massive 7200 RPM HDD; what could go wrong? It's the best for its price!<br><br>99% of games can run on this laptop will minimal issues and awesome graphics. The fans are quiet on idol mode and get a bit loud on heavy use. Everything is fast, responsive and amazing!<br><br>The battery life is on the poor side. On normal use (like web surfing), I got around 4 hours which means that you'll have to carry the bulky adapter around which would add some weight to the somewhat heavy laptop. While gaming, you can expect a solid hour but I'd rather plug-in and play. Most of the gaming potential is lost when on battery so just plug 'n play!<br><br>The screen is fine. My unit's backlight bleed is not much of a bother although I would prefer a slight increase in brightness. I'm not much of a video editor so I don't know much about the colour accuracy. It's fine to say the least.<br><br>The keyboard is good. Trackpad is good. The speakers aren't the best.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this to any budget gamer!",5.0 out of 5 stars
760,Awesome Mid Range Gaming Laptop,Review after 7 days of usage<br>Pros-<br>1. Intel I5 Processor does most of everyday work without any lag or performance issues<br>2. NVIDIA GTX 1650 provides 60+ fps for Need for speed games and around 55-60 fps for witcher 3 at high settings<br>3. Trackpad and keyboard feel good<br>4.Windows loaded on SSD makes it super fast with around 5-7 sec boot load time<br>5. Audio from speakers ok as long as u dont keep it flat on bed and instead on a raised surface.<br>6. Battery Backup around 4:30 to 5:30 hrs for normal day to day internet browsing provided brightness kept at 50%. But battery charges up fast in 1:30-1:45 hrs<br><br>CONS:<br>1. Audio could have been better because currently speakers placed in downward direction<br>2. Display brightness could be a little better<br>3. Very slight Screen bleed from left top side<br><br>While Gaming CPU temps reaches 91-95C  which cause thermal throttling. This can be avoided by undervolting the CPU.After Undervolting CPU temp stays around 79-85C which is a great dip.<br>8GB Ram bit on low side for graphic intensive games .Would recommend an upgrade to 16 GB Ram .<br><br>But Cons don't matter much because Pros are too awesome.<br>Would recommend anyone to buy this laptop.,5.0 out of 5 stars
761,Fantastic product but expensive at this price,"I bought this as my second laptop to work from home since my earlier lappie was not fast enough. I would say that this is a fantastic purchase. It takes less than 10sec to boot due to SSD and a powerful processor. I might replace HDD with a capable SSD later on. The battery lasts ~7-8 hrs for office work and have not checked it for gaming yet. The price is at least 10-15% higher than usual due to prevailing shortage of laptops in the market.  This could be due to anti China feeling as well. I realised this would continue till the festival season so went ahead and bought it. One should wait for price correction if not in any urgency. After one week of usage I would say that its screen, backlit keyboard and track pad are great.<br><br>One big con is that it is slightly higher weight so not very handy to carry in comparison to my previous lappie.  Screen could have been sharper and missing touchscreen at this price. At this price level they should have provided MS Office student version or antivirus for one year which only lasts for one month.",5.0 out of 5 stars

763,Subtly dressed young brother of predator series at a well thought price👌,"Brilliant Machine.<br>I would suggest upgrading the RAM to 16 GB and get a good cooler for avoiding thermal throttling during graphic intensive games like Far Cry 5 at high/ultra high. I personally use 2 fan cooler from ZinQ technologies.<br><br>The problem with mainstream gaming laptops like ROG Strix is that they are not easy to live with. They are built for gaming and gaming only. You sacrifice on the webcam and fan noise is unbearable at times. MSi lacks the after sales satisfaction which mainstream companies can provide. Lenovo Y540 is a great package but it comes at a premium price which to be honest, many of us can't afford. ACER Nitro 5 hits the sweet spot. Pricing is well thought. Quality is good enough and if your don't move around frequently, it will last you a long long time.<br><br>If you can afford this machine, don't think twice.<br>If you don't want to compromise on the performance, don't think twice.<br>If you want to pamper yourself with casual gaming, you are choosing the right products.<br><br>Feel free to drop questions if any.",5.0 out of 5 stars

You cannot substitute RGB with SSD , the poweful GTX 1650 , gddr5 ram , type c port and all .<br>Conclusion : So this is an amazingly beautiful and powerful machine in this price segment I feel .<br>Without any further delay you can go for it if your budget is around 60k .",5.0 out of 5 stars
769,Perfect for gaming at a budget,The temperature during gaming is acceptable.There are minimal frame drops while playing AAA titles but during light games like cs go and valorant there are no issues and the games can be run at their max settings at 1080p for long periods of time(3 to 4 hours) without any worry of thermal throttling.The screen of the Nitro 5 is not good.It is what you would expect of a  budget gaming laptop.The viewing angles are ok and there are some brightness issues so i would not recommend it for content creation.,5.0 out of 5 stars

873,Good with some minor setbacks.,"To sum it up, It's a bang for buck at 60k, which is the price I got it at. I've been using the device for about 2 months now, so here are the Pros and Cons<br>Pros<br>1. Decent Battery Backup For a Gaming Laptop , I get around 5hrs for normal use however for continuous video playback I get around 3.5 hrs. Didn't test for gaming on battery though as I prefer gaming while plugged in for peak performance.<br>2. Ergonomics are good. Has a slim profile and is well built, doesn't feel cheap at all and is sturdy. Weight balance is also good.<br>3. Port selection is good and conveniently located.<br>4. Gaming performance is as expected , can play AAA titles on high/ultra at decent FPS. Keyboard is decent enough.<br>5. Thermal Management is decent as well and has option for manual control of Fans through Nitrosense.<br>6. Charging Speed is quite good, charges from 0-100 in around 1hr 40mins<br> Now for the Cons<br>1. Slight screen bleeding but can be adjusted by applying little force on screen. Not noticeable in well lit environment or on low brightness.<br>2. The headphone Jack is tricky, it doesn't work when inserted normally, you have to insert the pin quick, like fast. Maybe issue with my piece but it's bearable.<br>Rest assured, it's a good buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
874,Overall performance,"As for the camera, well you cannot expect a Laptop camera to be like your phone camera and click selfies with it! It's a decent enough camera!<br><br>Battery, as for minimum usage (MS Office, MS Teams, Zoom, etc), it could easily stretch around 4-5 hrs, and if you enable the battery saver mode (which is quite effective indeed), then even longer! And while gaming, you may sit with your laptop near the socket, all plugged in and ready, in brief, of course gaming drains the battery faster, so keep your charger plugged in at that time.<br><br>Now when it comes to gaming, it can handle high end games easily.<br><br>Speakers are okay. You can adjust your speaker preset through the Nitrosense app (for which you have the “N” key beside the Number Lock key), and that way you can choose a louder preset!<br><br>Build Quality isn't really the best, but hey, it's not bad either!<br><br>Overall, it's not at all a bad choice; but if you are able to, then do choose a gaming laptop which costs from 70k - 80k, or one which isn't LCD to not experience any backlight bleeding",4.0 out of 5 stars
875,Overall Good product. Honest review,"I am writing this review after 21 days of buying. Display is good, but there is screen bleeding issue, my laptop has so much screen bleeding but after laptop start it's bleeding not seen. Battery for normal use is 4-5 hours, I have not played yet game, but when I'll play I'll again write review for that. Booting is very fast (3 sec).<br>Backlit is also usefull. Audio is Good. some people says that audio is very less, but it's not, audio is good. Webcam is not so good and not so bad it's just meadium, but it doesn't matter so much.it doesn't heat for normal use,I don't know for gaming, but I'll absolutely tell after I play games on that. Fans are very good for cooling. No problem about processor it's really good. Graphics Card is also good. Look is also very good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
876,Good for its range,It's a good laptop for those with graphics and designing needs with a low budget.<br>For gamers I wouldn't recommend as the graphic card is way behind its 3000 series cousins. I would suggest a custom desktop built if you want gaming + heavy duty work as it generates a lot of heat if not properly managed may damage the system,4.0 out of 5 stars
877,4 star. Good product. Read the review.,"Really smooth. Boots up before you know it.<br>Am having my MBA classes online coz of Covid, and this device is great at handling multitasking, like multi tab operations, multiple apps, video meets with research on the side.<br>Speakers are better than average, although expected more loudness and clarity.<br>Hasnt heated up even once in the past one week...and the fans haven't been used to even half their potential yet.<br>Am not a gamer.<br>Battery lasts for upto 5 hours while multitasking. And 6-6.30 hours while single tasking.<br>Got it for 60k. Found it to be worth it.<br><br>Also, i didnt give it 5 stars since no product is perfect XD.",4.0 out of 5 stars
878,Amazing!!!,"An amazing product to buy at such a prize.<br>Everything is up to the mark.. Build quality,  screen, performance, gaming experience. Battery life could have been better, the product description says it to be 11hrs but for normal use it will last around 4 hrs &amp; on gaming around 1-1.5 hrs.<br><br>Also I initially received a corrupted OS , my system was not booted up after first restart, but acer covers it in the warranty &amp; install a new OS although I have to take it to the service centre, so a little disappointed by that.",4.0 out of 5 stars
879,Worth the price,"works amazingly, clear screen, good battery life without gaming comes for about 4.5 hrs. needs to be plugged for gaming for better gaming experience, keyboard needs some getting used to (difficult to type takes time), charge slot at the side makes an awkward position , runs NFS payback at highest graphics that's enough for me ;)<br>speakers average, lots of noise gets added vibrations, the maxaudio app barely reduces it but need to use as better alternative than very low volume without this app.",4.0 out of 5 stars
880,"A very good laptop for gaming, video editing and normal work","Pros- good display, ok processor,good graphics card, good IO, good looking and a ok battery life<br>Cons- won't charge with USB type c, mediocre webcam and mediocre keyboard and mousepad<br><br>fps in games- gta 5 60 to 90 fps high settings, red dead redemption 2- 45 fps balanced settings, Forza horizon 5- 60 fps medium settings,<br>video editing- smooth<br>office work- good (you should buy a cheaper laptop if you just do office work)",4.0 out of 5 stars

885,Worth it!,Got it for a great price by exchanging it for an old ThinkPad and a few discounts during the Diwali sale. Acer has built this laptop really well. Quick and responsive in day to day tasks. Video edits/Renders and compositing work was quite smooth. The 8gb Ram is a bit less but can be user upgraded later.,4.0 out of 5 stars
886,Great Product and Great Service too,"It's a great product, very fast and multitasking is very easy. Bought it for 65k and now the price is 72k.<br>Switching through apps is cake walk.

939,Beast but points to read,"I am giving a mixed review. First of all it's a beast.Firstly, remove the stock norton inside it. It's a crap. Register product via inbuild software for it.Install something good. Didn't played any games yet. Will edit its review later. Laptop heats little bit for longrun. If turn on coolboost inside nitrosense, then it's ok.Coolpad is not necessary. Talking about display, we can safely overclock it upto 90HZ from 60HZ via intel utility. I don't recommend it since display lifespan will get affected for long run. I heard on playing high end games, it heats upto 90°c. If that's the condition, we have to undervolt it using throttle stop. I didn't got the ideal voltage for it. If i got it i will update it here. Build is too good and for gaming keyboard ASD keys are little bit to improve. May be you feel some difference. One Usb is always on after shutdown it's a feature. If you get it below or at 65k, it's the best. Actual store price is around 73k. By the way i upgraded to 10 pro now with office 2019+8GB stick upgraded.<br>After 1 month: Product is more than expected level of performance.Most AAA games runs butter smooth and runs in ultra sets, but understand that cpu temperature will reach as high as 96c. So if you don't have courage to undervolt it, don't buy it for high end gaming. Because you will feel always the fear about heat on cpu eventhough it can handle upto 100c. But anything abow 85c is considered not good.",4.0 out of 5 stars

There are hardly any cons in this product.<br>#Built quality is upto the mark.<br>#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop<br>#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.<br>#Processing speed is fluent.<br>#Camera is ok ok (enough).<br>#Touchpad feels premium.<br>#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.<br>#Display quality is more than good in this budget.<br><br>The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.<br><br>So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements.

1307,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .",4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery backup is good. Please check each and  every thing within 7 day's as you can get replacement or return within that period bcoz it's better  than replacing parts in new laptops.

1437,Excellent Value for Money Laptop.,"This is one good looking laptop. It's light, sufficiently powerful to run office and some light apps with email (i use it as a travel machine, so that is all i need to do with it. If i need to do other coding related work i use it to RDP into my work desktop). I recommended this to four other people two of which are students and use it heavily for taking notes, attending classes etc., and i have not heard them complain once. Excellent battery life.<br><br>One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.<br><br>Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.<br><br>Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.<br><br>There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.<br><br>All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case.",5.0 out of 5 stars

LESS NOISE!

1532,dv1001TU  - Reflective screen. Problems with Display Port for second monitor.,"&nbsp;I got the DV1001TU  model. Product description claims to be anti-glare screen but in fact, it is so highly reflective like a mirror, that I can comb my hairs using it; very uncomfortable to work on. Touchscreen laptops usually have reflective screens (like the one on the right in the video that I've uploaded), but this is not even touchscreen. Simply unacceptable screen quality. The product is not returnable; it's replacement only and Amazon makes it a walk through hell, to return this on account of false description.<br><br>Connecting second monitor over USB-C DP does not work; second display as well as the laptop display starts losing signal.

1533,Laptop had a defective battery - Worst Experience ever from AMAZON &amp; HP,"Worst Amazon experience ever. This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.<br><br>Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!<br><br>The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.<br><br>The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop. I’m still waiting for confirmation that the laptop will be replaced. Pathetic experience from both Amazon and HP.

1534,Worst Product by HP @Hepty price,"&nbsp;1. I bought this laptop in exchange. Old laptop had a Lil crash on it. Delivery guy first denied to exchange as there was a small crack. When I said to back the new product he asked me some money and said he ll manage at his end. I didn't pay him. Later on he agreed to take old product and in case if it gets rejected in the policy he ll take back new laptop. But nothing went wrong so he didn't call me back after.<br><br>2. Please see the images and video. In just 6 months of use I faced display flickering issue. Even though it was under warranty, I had to run to service center for repair. They tried to reinstall OS but it was of no use. Finally they had to change the entire display and to my surprise even that didn't solve the issue.<br><br>I am still facing the same flickering of display issue.<br>Frustrated with the service and quality of the product.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Talked to customer service, they have no idea how battery works and says full design capacity fluctuates charge by charge (WTF). Denied any repair or replacement. Service technicians have no idea what they are doing. Laptop heats up a lot (incredibly uncomfortable to hold), I think CPU power management tuning is not done properly, did it myself by reading windows documentation, dose not heat up that much now. Overall good machine but that battery issue is just not acceptable. Service is non existent, they will frustrate you till you give up.

1567,Fantastic ultrabook around 63K INR budget.,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.<br>Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.<br><br>Some closing thoughts:<br>The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!",5.0 out of 5 stars
1568,Very happy with the laptop,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).<br><br>One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
1569,One Of the Ideal Laptop for professional or student use.,"I have been using this laptop since August, it's very compact and lightweight.

Due to lack of dedicated graphics card, games are not as smooth they should be but as a professional this device in one of the best.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1584,Value for money,"Writing this review after 15 days of usage. The box contains the laptop and the charging cable. The laptop weighs  exactly 1.4 KG, and it's quite nice. It has all the specifications as advertised, i.e. 16 GB ram, and 500 GB NVME SSD. It does not have IR camera so no face unlocking will support. The finger print sensor is fast. Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both. Battery life is not completely tested but it's fairly ok, as of now I have got backup worth of definitely 6 hrs.",5.0 out of 5 stars

1601,"At this budget, it’s surely a go-to-device! Powerful!","Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).<br><br>Clarifications/issue points:<br><br>1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.<br>2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.<br>3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.<br>4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.<br>5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)<br>6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.<br>7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.<br>8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>1. Configuration is best at this price level.<br>2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.<br>3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.<br>4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.<br>5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.<br>6. Display is average and gets the job done.<br>7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.<br>8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.<br>9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.<br><br>Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.<br><br>I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4.0 out of 5 stars

1604,High Performance packed in a sleek &amp; thin body,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it &amp; after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.<br><br>Build &amp; Looks are awesome. Very thin &amp; sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light &amp; noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.<br><br>Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) &amp; same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram &amp; 512 NvMe SSD.<br><br>Features: Comes with ""Office Home &amp; Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps &amp; Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full &amp; med bright).<br><br>Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.<br><br>Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures &amp; Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.<br><br>Speakers is unbelievably very loud &amp; clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.<br><br>Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push &amp; pull out.<br><br>I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc &amp; also my overall experience as I keep using more &amp; more.<br><br>Update after 2 weeks:<br>After lot of research &amp; by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself &amp; found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter &amp; it worked.",4.0 out of 5 stars

The HP Pavilion comes as a surprise  .<br><br>Positives<br>Light to carry , great screen display , perfect picture and a good bundling<br><br>Negatives<br>Only two UAB ports so you need a USB Bus , keyboard with backlit is at times blinding , keys are a bit flimsy and there is no accessory like a carry bag, mouse, mouse pad etc . Looks delicate overall as compared to much earlier versions<br><br>Overall a decent buy if you use an external keyboard and have a USB Hub .",4.0 out of 5 stars
1609,Indeed the best laptop for Business and Personal Use. Still a decent one for Gaming too.,"I was almost checking several laptops in the price range of 55K - 70K INR and finally took this HP Pavilion 2021 for a great deal. I was initially reluctant in buying this over Lenovo Legion or Ideapad later understood I have done the right thing.<br><br>Coming back to the specs and overall review, just one word this laptop is AMAZING and worth buying. The bootup time is just 3 seconds. Intel Core i7 (11 Gen) is mind-boggling and SSD is an added advantage. The camera quality is convincing and the charging speed is okay. MS office students pack is a worthier inclusion and WIN 11 auto-update is top-notch.<br><br>The only con I felt in this device is a minute and very milder earth shocks observed in the other bezels (owing to the metal bezels) which is bearable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
1610,Good for home use,"The laptop is compact and light. Good bright screen resolution. Perfect size for my requirements for home usage and for my singing. While copying files from my hard drive, the computer kept hanging off and on and gave me trouble . Have been trying to delete old files after transferring to the new computer. Also difficult to get used to the absence of a right click option without a mouse. Overall hence a 4 rating.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Chrome OS works way better with minimal lag. The only decent tablet around this price point is the iPad 9, which is a great device but iPadOS doesn't offer desktop like functionality.<br>2.

1678,"Good laptop, questionable longevity","At features and price, this is a good laptop. The screen quality is decent and the setup is convenient. This is running Celeron, so obviously there's no gaming for this machine. It's unfortunate, but that three month game pass is pretty much useless. MS Office setup is easy and straightforward.<br><br>There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.<br><br>Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.<br><br>Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Intall big stuff there and work on either of your devices per your mobility needs. Like installing DB on desktop and doing development on this laptop.<br>5.

1822,Good device if you know how to use it,"DECENTLY FAST LAPTOP ONCE YOU SET IT UP!<br>First: Once you start it after unboxing and set up the windows, it will perform slow for a bit. Don't worry. Go into settings, windows update, and download all updates &amp; restart to install the downloaded updates. This will take some time. Be patient.<br>Second: When all windows updates are installed and the OS is upto date, for the time being, uninstall bloatwares like Prime video, Instagram, WhatsApp, xbox etc. Clean it up as much as possible by removing unnecessary apps. Set up McAfee Live Safe by opening it up from app tray.<br>Third: Most importantly, this machine comes with Windows S mode i.e. you can only download apps from MS Store. If you want a decently fast machine, stay in the S mode. Forget Chrome, use Edge browser built in. Its based on chromium only. If you want to slow the machine down, Google how to get out of S mode.<br><br>Conclusion: For the price (similar to a chromebook) it is a good laptop for browsing on Edge browser, YouTube, Netflix, Prime video, MS office, MS Teams, Zoom etc. All this can be done in S mode smoothly.<br><br>Update: At this price point, the keyboard is of really good quality.

1927,A great laptop if you know how ...,"Do you know how many laptops have dual drive? Hardly any. Most of the high end i5s and Rizens come with a single M.2 interface and you are stuck with the factory given SSD of measly 256 GB or 512 GB space. Now you'll say I can buy a larger capacity SSD. OK, what's the cost of a 2 TB NVME? At least 16K and what happens to the older nvme stick?. This is why I always buy laptops with dual drives and this laptop has it. You can have<br>- One nvme m.2 drive<br>- One regular SATA3 interface HDD or SSD<br><br>With the above option, you can have a 512 GB SSD (3.5K INR for Crucial) with 1 TB HDD allowing you to store all your songs, movies etc. and YET have the FULL speed of an SSD based system.<br><br>Though I did not purchase this laptop at Amazon, I bought it from a local store for 1K higher price, after initial start I noticed how SLOW everything was. In fact even my laptop 15 years older is a lot faster. In any case I never intended to use the default HDD but I was curious to know HOW slow it could be after reading everyone's reviews - YES it is SUPER SLOW.<br><br>Then I stuffed in a P1 500GB NVME SSD and re-installed Windows 11 and the performance was mind-blowing - actually not really mind blowing because I have been using high perf laptops for quite some time - the minimum RAM any of my laptops have is 20 GB minimum. Now this laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM, but I found Windows 11 to be quite responsive and snappy for all basic work like YouTube, browsing, Discord, listening to music and the likes. I can always replace the 4 GB RAM stick with a 16 GB RAM stick to have a total RAM of 20 GB which is pretty good.<br><br>In case anyone wants to know how to re-install Windows 11 on an SSD read on..<br>1. Start your new laptop, register Windows 11 etc. Ensure you note down the Microsoft account that you use to register. Also search the Internet on how to print your Windows 11 CD Key, this is a command run in the command prompt, you can write down the CD key or mail the CD key to yourself.<br>2. Search for ""download windows 11 media creation tool"" and go to the Microsoft site which comes up in the search hits<br>3. Select the second option of ""Create Windows 11 Installation Media"". This will download a tool which you need to run.<br>4. You will need to have a USB Pen Drive of at least 8 GB capacity.<br>5. When you run the downloaded program, it will ask you to confirm if the Windows Installer should be created on the attach USB Pen drive, confirm this.<br>6. Depending on your internet connection speed this process will complete in 10-15 minutes.<br>7. You now need to go to the ""Settings App"" -&gt; Select ""Recovery"" -&gt; Select ""Advanced Startup"" . OR keep the SHIFT button down when clicking the ""RESTART"" button.<br>8. The computer will reboot but instead of going directly into Windows, select to boot from attached device. Now Windows Installer will load from the USB drive and you can install Windows 11 completely fresh. Note: during installation you should select 'Advanced' and select to install Windows on the new HDD (SSD). The installation usually completes in 15 minutes, YES, SSD makes it THAT fast. I would advise against deleting the existing Windows 11 partitions that are present in the original HDD (just in case). You can always format the HDD after Windows 11 has been successfully installed on the new SSD.<br>9. You'll have to again enter details like the PC name etc. Ensure you use the SAME Microsoft account to register your copy of Windows 11, it will auto-activate. In case registration fails, you can always use the CD KEY you printed in the first step to activate Windows 11.<br>10. Once Windows 11 is fully installed using the laptop will be a totally different experience.<br><br>Anyway, those of you who already purchased this laptop, you made a great choice, if you want the same performance as other laptops, I strongly advise you to do a fresh install of Windows 11 or even Windows 10, this ensure NO additional software is installed which vendors always install for marketing, data collection purposed, all these useless software only make your computer slow.<br><br>-- all the best --",5.0 out of 5 stars
1928,Value for money,"This is a good product at this economical price range. intially it would be slow and disappoint us.

One or more keys stop working within an year. After the first replacement during manufacturers warranty, I decided to extend my warranty for another year and that has saved me from a big expense.<br><br>The worst part is the keyboard is not a replaceable component on its own. The keyboard is part of an assembly that includes the touchpad, speakers and the top frame on which one rests one hand while typing, see pics for details. Besides the design of the hand rest where there is a drop in the hand rest where the trackpad ends and the keyboard begins is faulty, this drop touches and rubs against the screen when the laptop is shut and screen is folded down as one would normally carry or store the laptop.<br><br>without extended warranty this laptop is unaffordable as Lenovo will replace the whole assembly comprising of speakers &amp; trackpad if the keyboard malfunctions, which has now happened twice with me, each time a new one was replaced.<br><br>If one has to replace a faulty keyboard at ones own cost, one will be billed for the replacement speakers as well as the trackpad which may be perfectly ok as was in my case, not once but twice.<br><br>I cannot even begin to understand why this is so, it must have come through in QA and testing, if any was done at all.

2355,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .",4.0 out of 5 stars

Performace is good as the clock speed of processor is 3 Ghz (not 4.1 which is maximum extent of clocking purformance of the processor.<br>Pro:-<br>1. Looks premium ( hp logo is cheery on top)<br>2. Keyboard quality is good and all necessary keys are present on keyboard (no need of pressing fn for some important keys like home, pageup and page down etc.<br>3. Speaker quality is very good compared to lenovo, asus or dell in this price range. Loud and clear.<br>4. Two usb type A 3.0 and one usb type C 3.0 (might be 3.2 I am not sure)<br>5. Pre-installed OS and office with lifetime validity<br>6. Browsing speed is also very good<br><br>Con:-<br>1. Visibility of alphabets and numbers becomes very bad in low light condition (might not be a con for experienced typist). Keys are not even like somwhere its ok and somwhere its bumpy or not aligned properly. But typing will not get affected.<br>2. Screen quality is very down grade. Other laptops like Asus are providing Oled display in this price range. Brightness is very low. My old lenovo Ideapad has better brightness and clearity of screen than this laptop (which I bought for Rs. 25K before 5 years)<br>3. For those who wants to extend the screen for uptop 2 monitors, the given USB C port doesnt support video output so you can only connect one monitor at a time.<br>4. No option to expand SSD storage as it only supports 512 Gb (which is already included) and no extra SSD slot or even HDD slot.<br><br>Can't say:<br>1. Performace will get tested after heavy usage so will update later<br>2. Not faced heating issue which will only get tested after heavy usage<br><br>Edit:<br>1) Battery last for 6 to 7 hours while using only excel or any other basic work<br>2) Good news for GTA 5 lovers as it can run but on low settings.

2615,Good deal for everyone.,"Lenovo ideapad series are midrange laptops which are suitable for pretty much everyone. You can watch movies, play most games at reduced graphics settings, read ebooks for long,  video and photo editing.  It doesn't come with a dedicated graphics card, so if you are looking something for AutoCAD, don't go for it.<br><br>Excellent Laptop. Great Finish and built quality. Boots in seconds. Screen resolution is very good and great viewing angles with awesome silver colour. If you want something from HP, please see one similar laptop from HP here .. it costs whooping 59k and this Lenovo laptop is price at 49k. So thumps up to Lenovo.<br><br>Pros:<br>1)The build of laptop is excellent with premium built quality. It feels very slim and light weight on daily usage.<br>2) Booting speed is great (2-3 second) and SSD works very fast.<br>3) The keyboard is a decent one for a laptop .<br>4) Touchpad is awsome and responsive with windows 10 gestures. Fingerprint is pretty good at its job.<br>5) Display quality is very good at this price range. Even at bright sunlight you can view the display effectively.<br>6) Batter backup is 5 - 6 hours at average usage.<br>7) Speaker are awesome and webcam is average but its better than expected.<br><br>Cons:<br>1) Sound is too crispy for my liking but most won't notice it.<br>2) Design is not that attractive.<br><br>No heating issue observed while normal browsing or typing. Touchpad is very responsive and all gestures are working really fine. Buttons seems a bit clicky . Let's see how long it lasts.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2617,"Good purchase, overall; and a few points I do hope they use to make improvements","Found this laptop to be v sleek, overall.<br>Like the keyboard (find the keys to be softer than most other laptop keyboards; more 'pleasant'? for typing, relatively speaking, though not quite as pleasant as it is w a MacBookPro).<br>Like the way the touchpad has been positioned slightly to the left.<br>Also like the fingerprint sensor doubling up as the power on/off button.<br>Front-facing cam quality also relatively good, along with wide coverage of (user) background.<br><br>Would have preferred more RAM along with the whole pkg.<br>Would have preferred more SSD storage space for this budget.<br><br>Budget-wise, feel this is priced up by about 20%, and I think that it will sell more units if Lenovo brings it down accordingly.<br><br>Overall, defn a good buy, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants this config of laptop for their business/home purposes.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2734,Harrowing experience,"&nbsp;Disclaimers:<br>1. My review is based on the rough 3 weeks for which I used it. Post that, I returned the product.<br>2. This review is not to be construed to mean that all products in this line are necessarily bad. It could be the case that only I had a bad experience.<br><br>I will state the cons first as they far outweigh the pros.<br>Cons:<br>A. The primary and probably the biggest con for me (which resulted in me returning the product )  was that the display would flicker at intervals (From Day 1 of using the product). Sometimes the flickering wouldn't persist for long  and would occur only for a few seconds. At other times, it would just go on and on, making work impossible and having to re-install the display driver to make it stop. I'd be using it mostly for work (Microsoft office and Adobe) and otherwise, to watch videos and movies. At an average, I'd have to reset (uninstall and reinstall) the Display Driver once every day. Never got around to gaming with it owing to the display flickering problem, as it  used to get quite irritating. (Refer to my video to understand the problem of flickering)<br><br>B. The speaker quality is very average.  The highest volume doesn't produce sound audible enough. So for music, movies etc. , you'd have to use speakers or earphones/headphones.<br><br>C. Acer support  is not upto the mark. After raising my complaint with them and despite the fact that it was a brand new product , they did little to assuage my concerns. They refused to send anyone to pick up my product and said I'd have to get in touch with one of their service centres and personally go there to deliver it. Neither did they give any assurance on a timeline within which they would be able to resolve my problem, nor did they offer a temporary laptop to use while this one got fixed (this was a real problem as I need a functional  laptop at any given point in time and I had also explained my situation to them).<br><br>D. The charger input slot is such that you have to insert the charger at a certain angle; otherwise it's difficult to insert. And to get that angle right is quite difficult. I would keep it plugged in and operate it by switching on and off the main switch (like a Desktop PC).<br><br>E. Battery life is not too good. I wasn't even doing any heavy work or gaming and the battery would last for hardly 4-4.5 hours before reaching 20% from full charge.<br><br>Pros:<br>A. Amazon support was pretty good as compared to dismal Acer support. They arranged for a technician to come and  inspect the problem I had complained of. Amazon does not have a return and refund policy for electronic items and only a replacement policy in case of defective goods. Thereafter , after the technican uploaded his report, I was assured that I would get a replacement of the defective product with a brand new product. However, as it turned out, the seller had exhausted his stock of the product with no idea on when he'd be able to procure new stock. So all in all, I stood to get a full refund after a return was arranged. Just returned the product and am awaiting my refund to reflect in my account.<br><br>B. The fans are placed stategically such that it does not heat up while working. This is particularly good for heavy gaming.<br><br>C. The display resolution is pretty good (my flickering issue aside).<br><br>D. Machine performance is really fast.<br><br>E. Looks stylish.<br><br>To conclude, my advice would be to purchase from an authorised store (whatever laptop you're purchasing, irrespective of the make) after physical verification. It's better that way.  Prices may be cheaper online, but you get quality assurance through physical purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars

So, on one fine day I was working on something and suddenly ""No Bootable Device"" error popped up. Then I called support and they sent a Engineer. So They replaced the SSD and the issue was resolved in one week. Then after two days of usage, the laptop failed again, and again started giving an error of ""No Bootable Device"". Then again I called up support and this time they changed the MOTHERBOAD. Then after one day of usage the charger stopped working.  So again I called up the support and told them this product is complete failure and please give me a replacement. This has been going for one month now. And my work has severely affected. Now when I mailed the support for the replacement of the product because it's just a train of failures in this product, they replied me that I'm on my own and they only can give me services and not a replacement and clearly this is a defected product. So now you can decide after reading this review that you should/shouldn't purchase ACER products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
2758,This is the Last laptop I would choose if I wanted one,First of all I would like to point out that the service quality of the company is bad and the laptop would over heat on while playing low graphic games like roblox. The laptop also shut down after only a year and had to get a service for it. The thermal paste they use for the system is also of bad quality . All and all I am very dissatisfied with the performance of the device and would never ever again buy a laptop from acer again. this laptop only 1 year use after that you will have to throw in the dustbin. to buy this laptop my all the money had been gone waste.,1.0 out of 5 stars

Actually the whole story is I brought in an exchange offer and there was nothing to mention about the damage details of previous one .

2800,Probably the best budget gaming laptop in India currently.,"I felt that the Acer Nitro 5 2019 model would lack in a lot of important spheres, mostly pertaining to music production (I use FL Studio very often with plugins which take a huge toll on the CPU), as well as gaming. But, I have not been disappointed at all.<br><br>PROS:<br>A) The CPU is amazing. As I write this review, I am aware of the fact that the Acer Nitro 5 2020 edition has been released with a stronger i5 10th generation processor, but for the people who think the 9th generation CPU lacks anywhere, you're clearly mistaken. The 10th generation is better, but there are no seismic differences between the 2 generations. No problems with any of the plugins in FL Studio and the CPU handles most recent titles, such as Death Stranding exceptionally well.<br>B) GTX 1650 is easily the best budget gaming GPU that you can get. Of course, the GTX 1650ti is also a formidable opponent, but I am having absolutely no issues with the GPU. The frames per second (FPS) I am getting on games like Death Stranding, Rainbow Six Siege, Watch Dogs 2, Grand Theft Auto V, Tekken 7, etc. is more than enough.<br>C) The 8GB RAM is good, although you should definitely go for another 8GB stick. The more, the merrier :)<br>D) Many people have talked about screen bleeding issues. I personally don't have that problem. Although 60Hz on a panel of this laptop's caliber seems awkward, I don't have anything else to complain about when it comes to the display. The hertz can be overclocked to around 90Hz or so.<br>E) Keyboard feels good and responsive.<br>F) Battery backup is respectable.<br><br>CONS:<br>A) Don't even want to talk about the speakers.<br><br>Overall, for casual gaming, this laptop is amazing. I am having tons of fun with it, and for someone who upgraded from a stupid Geforce 920M GPU and an i3 4th generation CPU, this fulfills my need perfectly.<br>To quote a joke well known in the gaming community: 10/10, IGN!",5.0 out of 5 stars
2801,"""Best Budget Gaming Laptop""","Writing review after almost using for 3 months.<br>Boot up is very quick.<br>It has many other features like NitroSense, Acer Network Optimiser and Acer Quick Access.<br>So these are value addition to the product.<br>Looks premium in design.<br>But not a metal body though as in case of Nitro 7 which is costlier.But it's absolutely fine.<br>Camera is average or enough and that's the case with all the laptops.So as such you can't complain about camera.<br>You get 930 GB of HDD and around 236 GB of SSD.But since Windows is installed on SSD so you get around 200 GB only.<br>Played games like GTA V, PUBG in ultra graphics settings and also installed softwares like Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Media Encoder.All work perfectly and no significant lags experienced.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Also the brightness level of the keyboard light can be adjusted with 4 different brightness levels.<br>So this is one more feature.<br>The dual cooling is also very effective.<br>The speakers are also great.<br>They are too good for a gaming laptop, a lot more than what I expected.<br>No issues with display as well.<br>You get a 1080 p screen which is normal.<br>Also what I liked a lot are the very THIN BEZELS.<br>So due to this, the screen looks a lot better.<br>So overall no issues experienced till now.<br>Everything is working perfectly.<br>Only SSD can be added as it has one vacant SSD slot.<br>Will mostly add another 16 GB RAM and a half TB SSD, if not a TB to run it flawlessly for future.<br>Hope you find the review helpful !!😊😊",5.0 out of 5 stars
2802,Performance is good obviously because it is new now let's see,"Received the laptop the next day itself after ordering. The packaging was not good, just a big box with the laptop box inside it. No visible damage though. The box contains a laptop and charger with some cool stickers along with a user manual (who reads that these days, lol) and a warranty card.<br><br>After using it for almost 2 years... It has stopped working... Not able to find what the issue is. Doesn't charge, doesn't power up. Stopped working suddenly in between gameplay due to overheating and won't work. I was using a cooling pad and power supply etc was fine. Sad to see such poor quality products.<br><br>After 3 days of testing, benchmarking and heavy usage:<br><br>Pros:<br>1.

For normal use like chrome, music, movies I get approx 6 hours of backup.<br><br>Editing: up to 2k resolution video in the premiere pro is really smooth for editing. photoshop/Lightroom no issues with speed. But the screen color is not much good, it's an okay kind of thing. (In this price range it's really good)<br><br>Gaming: I am not a hardcore gamer, I played Forza Horizon 4 and GTA 5. I don't get any lagging issues.  Always plug in a charger and play.<br><br>Hardware: Overall good quality no issues till now. I like the keyboard it's nice, the trackpad is smooth compared with hp pavilion<br><br>Speaker: It's Okay not very good.<br><br>Screen: Good for watching movies and gaming, I won't suggest you if you are a professional video/photo editor.",5.0 out of 5 stars
2805,Awesome!,"After a month of usage, all I have to say is this: this laptop is the budget king!<br><br>For this price, a powerful Core i5 processor, reasonably powerful GTX 1650 graphics card, 8 GB RAM (although I'd recommend an upgrade to 12/16 GB), fast PCIe SSD, massive 7200 RPM HDD; what could go wrong? It's the best for its price!<br><br>99% of games can run on this laptop will minimal issues and awesome graphics. The fans are quiet on idol mode and get a bit loud on heavy use. Everything is fast, responsive and amazing!<br><br>The battery life is on the poor side. On normal use (like web surfing), I got around 4 hours which means that you'll have to carry the bulky adapter around which would add some weight to the somewhat heavy laptop. While gaming, you can expect a solid hour but I'd rather plug-in and play. Most of the gaming potential is lost when on battery so just plug 'n play!<br><br>The screen is fine. My unit's backlight bleed is not much of a bother although I would prefer a slight increase in brightness. I'm not much of a video editor so I don't know much about the colour accuracy. It's fine to say the least.<br><br>The keyboard is good. Trackpad is good. The speakers aren't the best.<br><br>I would definitely recommend this to any budget gamer!",5.0 out of 5 stars
2806,Awesome Mid Range Gaming Laptop,Review after 7 days of usage<br>Pros-<br>1. Intel I5 Processor does most of everyday work without any lag or performance issues<br>2. NVIDIA GTX 1650 provides 60+ fps for Need for speed games and around 55-60 fps for witcher 3 at high settings<br>3. Trackpad and keyboard feel good<br>4.Windows loaded on SSD makes it super fast with around 5-7 sec boot load time<br>5. Audio from speakers ok as long as u dont keep it flat on bed and instead on a raised surface.<br>6. Battery Backup around 4:30 to 5:30 hrs for normal day to day internet browsing provided brightness kept at 50%. But battery charges up fast in 1:30-1:45 hrs<br><br>CONS:<br>1. Audio could have been better because currently speakers placed in downward direction<br>2. Display brightness could be a little better<br>3. Very slight Screen bleed from left top side<br><br>While Gaming CPU temps reaches 91-95C  which cause thermal throttling. This can be avoided by undervolting the CPU.After Undervolting CPU temp stays around 79-85C which is a great dip.<br>8GB Ram bit on low side for graphic intensive games .Would recommend an upgrade to 16 GB Ram .<br><br>But Cons don't matter much because Pros are too awesome.<br>Would recommend anyone to buy this laptop.,5.0 out of 5 stars
2807,Fantastic product but expensive at this price,"I bought this as my second laptop to work from home since my earlier lappie was not fast enough. I would say that this is a fantastic purchase. It takes less than 10sec to boot due to SSD and a powerful processor. I might replace HDD with a capable SSD later on. The battery lasts ~7-8 hrs for office work and have not checked it for gaming yet. The price is at least 10-15% higher than usual due to prevailing shortage of laptops in the market.  This could be due to anti China feeling as well. I realised this would continue till the festival season so went ahead and bought it. One should wait for price correction if not in any urgency. After one week of usage I would say that its screen, backlit keyboard and track pad are great.<br><br>One big con is that it is slightly higher weight so not very handy to carry in comparison to my previous lappie.  Screen could have been sharper and missing touchscreen at this price. At this price level they should have provided MS Office student version or antivirus for one year which only lasts for one month.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I personally use 2 fan cooler from ZinQ technologies.<br><br>The problem with mainstream gaming laptops like ROG Strix is that they are not easy to live with. They are built for gaming and gaming only. You sacrifice on the webcam and fan noise is unbearable at times. MSi lacks the after sales satisfaction which mainstream companies can provide. Lenovo Y540 is a great package but it comes at a premium price which to be honest, many of us can't afford. ACER Nitro 5 hits the sweet spot. Pricing is well thought. Quality is good enough and if your don't move around frequently, it will last you a long long time.<br><br>If you can afford this machine, don't think twice.<br>If you don't want to compromise on the performance, don't think twice.<br>If you want to pamper yourself with casual gaming, you are choosing the right products.<br><br>Feel free to drop questions if any.",5.0 out of 5 stars

2919,Good with some minor setbacks.,"To sum it up, It's a bang for buck at 60k, which is the price I got it at. I've been using the device for about 2 months now, so here are the Pros and Cons<br>Pros<br>1. Decent Battery Backup For a Gaming Laptop , I get around 5hrs for normal use however for continuous video playback I get around 3.5 hrs. Didn't test for gaming on battery though as I prefer gaming while plugged in for peak performance.<br>2. Ergonomics are good. Has a slim profile and is well built, doesn't feel cheap at all and is sturdy. Weight balance is also good.<br>3. Port selection is good and conveniently located.<br>4. Gaming performance is as expected , can play AAA titles on high/ultra at decent FPS. Keyboard is decent enough.<br>5. Thermal Management is decent as well and has option for manual control of Fans through Nitrosense.<br>6. Charging Speed is quite good, charges from 0-100 in around 1hr 40mins<br> Now for the Cons<br>1. Slight screen bleeding but can be adjusted by applying little force on screen. Not noticeable in well lit environment or on low brightness.<br>2. The headphone Jack is tricky, it doesn't work when inserted normally, you have to insert the pin quick, like fast. Maybe issue with my piece but it's bearable.<br>Rest assured, it's a good buy.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2920,Overall performance,"As for the camera, well you cannot expect a Laptop camera to be like your phone camera and click selfies with it! It's a decent enough camera!<br><br>Battery, as for minimum usage (MS Office, MS Teams, Zoom, etc), it could easily stretch around 4-5 hrs, and if you enable the battery saver mode (which is quite effective indeed), then even longer! And while gaming, you may sit with your laptop near the socket, all plugged in and ready, in brief, of course gaming drains the battery faster, so keep your charger plugged in at that time.<br><br>Now when it comes to gaming, it can handle high end games easily.<br><br>Speakers are okay. You can adjust your speaker preset through the Nitrosense app (for which you have the “N” key beside the Number Lock key), and that way you can choose a louder preset!<br><br>Build Quality isn't really the best, but hey, it's not bad either!<br><br>Overall, it's not at all a bad choice; but if you are able to, then do choose a gaming laptop which costs from 70k - 80k, or one which isn't LCD to not experience any backlight bleeding",4.0 out of 5 stars
2921,Overall Good product. Honest review,"I am writing this review after 21 days of buying. Display is good, but there is screen bleeding issue, my laptop has so much screen bleeding but after laptop start it's bleeding not seen. Battery for normal use is 4-5 hours, I have not played yet game, but when I'll play I'll again write review for that. Booting is very fast (3 sec).<br>Backlit is also usefull. Audio is Good. some people says that audio is very less, but it's not, audio is good. Webcam is not so good and not so bad it's just meadium, but it doesn't matter so much.it doesn't heat for normal use,I don't know for gaming, but I'll absolutely tell after I play games on that. Fans are very good for cooling. No problem about processor it's really good. Graphics Card is also good. Look is also very good.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2922,Good for its range,It's a good laptop for those with graphics and designing needs with a low budget.<br>For gamers I wouldn't recommend as the graphic card is way behind its 3000 series cousins. I would suggest a custom desktop built if you want gaming + heavy duty work as it generates a lot of heat if not properly managed may damage the system,4.0 out of 5 stars
2923,4 star. Good product. Read the review.,"Really smooth. Boots up before you know it.<br>Am having my MBA classes online coz of Covid, and this device is great at handling multitasking, like multi tab operations, multiple apps, video meets with research on the side.<br>Speakers are better than average, although expected more loudness and clarity.<br>Hasnt heated up even once in the past one week...and the fans haven't been used to even half their potential yet.<br>Am not a gamer.<br>Battery lasts for upto 5 hours while multitasking. And 6-6.30 hours while single tasking.<br>Got it for 60k. Found it to be worth it.<br><br>Also, i didnt give it 5 stars since no product is perfect XD.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2924,Amazing!!!,"An amazing product to buy at such a prize.<br>Everything is up to the mark.. Build quality,  screen, performance, gaming experience. Battery life could have been better, the product description says it to be 11hrs but for normal use it will last around 4 hrs &amp; on gaming around 1-1.5 hrs.<br><br>Also I initially received a corrupted OS , my system was not booted up after first restart, but acer covers it in the warranty &amp; install a new OS although I have to take it to the service centre, so a little disappointed by that.",4.0 out of 5 stars
2925,Worth the price,"works amazingly, clear screen, good battery life without gaming comes for about 4.5 hrs. needs to be plugged for gaming for better gaming experience, keyboard needs some getting used to (difficult to type takes time), charge slot at the side makes an awkward position , runs NFS payback at highest graphics that's enough for me ;)<br>speakers average, lots of noise gets added vibrations, the maxaudio app barely reduces it but need to use as better alternative than very low volume without this app.",4.0 out of 5 stars

2985,Beast but points to read,"I am giving a mixed review. First of all it's a beast.Firstly, remove the stock norton inside it. It's a crap. Register product via inbuild software for it.Install something good. Didn't played any games yet. Will edit its review later. Laptop heats little bit for longrun. If turn on coolboost inside nitrosense, then it's ok.Coolpad is not necessary. Talking about display, we can safely overclock it upto 90HZ from 60HZ via intel utility. I don't recommend it since display lifespan will get affected for long run. I heard on playing high end games, it heats upto 90°c. If that's the condition, we have to undervolt it using throttle stop. I didn't got the ideal voltage for it. If i got it i will update it here. Build is too good and for gaming keyboard ASD keys are little bit to improve. May be you feel some difference. One Usb is always on after shutdown it's a feature. If you get it below or at 65k, it's the best. Actual store price is around 73k. By the way i upgraded to 10 pro now with office 2019+8GB stick upgraded.<br>After 1 month: Product is more than expected level of performance.Most AAA games runs butter smooth and runs in ultra sets, but understand that cpu temperature will reach as high as 96c. So if you don't have courage to undervolt it, don't buy it for high end gaming. Because you will feel always the fear about heat on cpu eventhough it can handle upto 100c. But anything abow 85c is considered not good.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3134,Usfull,"&nbsp;This is such a premium looking laptop at this price point. Extremely light weight, classy looking body and keyboard, ssd boot, pre-installed windows 10, fingerprint recognition along with new features from the updated os. Everything is beautiful in both form and function. I am very satisfied with it, the packaging and even the small and compact power cable. Can't believe something so good can be available at this price point. The boot time is significantly fast than other laptops, comparable with macbook.

3139,Just go for it !!,Read till the end.<br>Reviewing after 12 days of usage.<br>If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.<br>#Built quality is upto the mark.<br>#Looks and feels premium like a 40k laptop<br>#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.<br>#Processing speed is fluent.<br>#Camera is ok ok (enough).<br>#Touchpad feels premium.<br>#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.<br>#Display quality is more than good in this budget.<br><br>The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.<br><br>So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements.

3226,Beware!!! A Good Budget Laptop but...,"&nbsp;Purchased this laptop at 25k, and using been using this for the last 10 months. Here is my brief review of the Laptop's performance.<br>Design: In the budget segment, most laptop has an average plastic build, but this one is different. Build Quality is awesome for the price. Even after using it for 10 months, there is no deterioration. Laptop lid is still pretty much solid- no wobbling or looseness.<br>Display: This laptop comes with a 15.6” HD display. Yes...it's an HD display which means it's not 1920x1080, the maximum resolution we can set is upto 1366x768. In this price segment we can easily find full HD laptops…so yes if you are into FHD display..you aren’t getting it in this laptop. Brightness is good for indoor usage.<br>Keyboard: This laptop comes with Chiclet style full standard size keyboard. These chiclet keycaps are small and need time to get used to them. Overall ok..ok…no problem till now.<br>Performance: As this is an entry-level laptop, it comes with an Intel Celeron processor which is built for a basic-light task only. I bought this laptop for office usage.. on which I am mostly using MS Office, Tally, and Chrome. With this kind of usage, we can even multitask. No issue at all, But if you are expecting some decent performance out of this laptop for, Gaming and animation tasks.. then this laptop can’t do that. Talking about the Entertainment, yes we can even enjoy 4K movies watching (watch the attached video for 4K Test), and as the in-built speakers are actually better than my expectation, you can watch movies with friends and family.<br><br>Now let me quickly share some Pros &amp; Cons:<br><br>PROS<br>1. Superb Build Quality<br>2. Looks premium in budget<br>3. Great Price-performance ratio<br>4. Lightweight (1.6kg)<br>5. Smooth 4k video playback<br>6. 2-3 hours battery backup<br>7. Fingerprint sensor<br><br>CONS<br>1. HD Screen (1366x768)<br>2. No LAN port<br>3. Poor Webcam (watch attached video)<br>4. Nonsense Upgrade options<br><br>I will update the review if find anything worth sharing.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3312,"Bad Design, Substandard Keyboard, dont buy this or any of its variant model laptops!!!","My Lenovo Ideapad 3 laptop is still in warranty and since Dec 2020 has had two keyboard replacements. One or more keys stop working within an year. After the first replacement during manufacturers warranty, I decided to extend my warranty for another year and that has saved me from a big expense.<br><br>The worst part is the keyboard is not a replaceable component on its own. The keyboard is part of an assembly that includes the touchpad, speakers and the top frame on which one rests one hand while typing, see pics for details. Besides the design of the hand rest where there is a drop in the hand rest where the trackpad ends and the keyboard begins is faulty, this drop touches and rubs against the screen when the laptop is shut and screen is folded down as one would normally carry or store the laptop.<br><br>without extended warranty this laptop is unaffordable as Lenovo will replace the whole assembly comprising of speakers &amp; trackpad if the keyboard malfunctions, which has now happened twice with me, each time a new one was replaced.<br><br>If one has to replace a faulty keyboard at ones own cost, one will be billed for the replacement speakers as well as the trackpad which may be perfectly ok as was in my case, not once but twice.<br><br>I cannot even begin to understand why this is so, it must have come through in QA and testing, if any was done at all. This is unacceptable, never again will I buy any Lenovo laptops again, this is my first and last Lenovo laptop.<br><br>Have had DELL, Toshiba, Asus and HP laptops in the past, none was as worthless and troublesome as this one.

3434,Best product for students under this range,This product is value for money.At this range you can do normal gaming and studying.just a little bit problem it get heated when use for 2 or 3 hours.if you want to do work for 5 or 6 hours you need a cooling pad i have ordered for 800 ruppes only.although this product is the best.,4.0 out of 5 stars
3435,Good laptop.,"I don't know why people are cribbing so much about the screen. The laptops which have an IPS display with a similar configuration (and 15.6"" screens) are mostly over Rs. 55000. You get what you pay for. The screen and display are absolutely fine otherwise (yes, you can watch movies and everything else). Also, this is one of the only few models in this price range which has a backlit keyboard. If an IPS display truly matters though, you do have some Lenovo, Acer and HP laptops which are &lt;45000. I'm not sure if they have backlit keyboards though. The only issue I have (and this applies to all other brands) is the fact that almost all the newer laptop models have really small Up and Down arrow keys which is very inconvenient if you use them a lot. My fingers are getting cramped up due to that. It takes a bit of time to get used to them. If you want standard sized arrow keys, get another model. The laptop works smoothly otherwise and is good for everyday use. Also, there's no point complaining that games work slowly because this is NOT a gaming laptop. The onboard graphics on this is roughly as powerful as a GeForce GTX 765m SLI, a GPU that was released in 2013. If you're playing games from that era, you can play them at 1080p at high settings. Don't expect today's games to run well. After cashback, I got this laptop for Rs. 43,690.5 .",4.0 out of 5 stars

Battery backup is good. Please check each and  every thing within 7 day's as you can get replacement or return within that period bcoz it's better  than replacing parts in new laptops.

3629,Excellent Value for Money Laptop.,"This is one good looking laptop. It's light, sufficiently powerful to run office and some light apps with email (i use it as a travel machine, so that is all i need to do with it. If i need to do other coding related work i use it to RDP into my work desktop). I recommended this to four other people two of which are students and use it heavily for taking notes, attending classes etc., and i have not heard them complain once. Excellent battery life.<br><br>One issue with the newer models is that they don't charge over USB c. My nephew has a older model of the same laptop which charges over USB c. Maybe this is some cost cutting gimick Lenovo has started pulling. Also my laptop shows no indication that it is charging when it is powered off. For my newphews machine, the led is on when it charges. There is also slight light bleed on my lcd from right right edge when the screen is pitch black but for all other laptops this problem doesnt exist. None of these are major issues but please be aware that Lenovo is pulling cost cutting gimicks in the new model.<br><br>Overall I would highly recommend this because if you are looking for a small laptop or two in one which is light and portable, there is literally nothing else in market that you can buy in this price range.<br><br>Some people use iPad or Android tablets for on the go work but I just could not do it. Bad software support on both (stripped down version of office, no support for wine on Android) and clunkly folio cases with bad keyboard and no mouse pad make tablets a really bad decission for anything other than content consumption and note taking with a stylus. You should only buy a tablet if those are your use cases. This machine though is the best of both worlds. With 7 to 8 hours of battery life it can pretty much couple up as a tablet.<br><br>There was a time when this machine used to come with free active stylus. Now, it doesn't. I don't even know if it supports stylus any more, since Lenovo seems to have gone completely silent about it in documentation.<br><br>All told if you are looking for a probable laptop to do some light but real work using Microsoft office, obsedian, notion etc. and have budget of twenty K this is what you want to buy. If you are a student with typical student use cases and don't want to play demanding games, again buy this machine. If you want to buy laptops for elders in the house, buy this laptop. Hope this clarifies and helps people make a decission depending on their use case.",5.0 out of 5 stars

LESS NOISE! LESS HEAT!<br><br>Battery lasts very long 8 hours give or take depending on what you're using it for (videos and streaming naturally will use more battery)<br><br>Speakers: On the Standard Size, but it is Tablet like, so that is to be expected, sounds like a standard tablet/mobile phone but audio quality is quite crisp and enhanced, but you won't get surround sound deep bass effect.<br><br>It is not meant for gaming, so don't give it aa bad review if it can't run your favorite games, it is a budget laptop that is extremely mobile, extremely portable 2 in 1 type, perfect for web browsing, video watching, email checking, word processing etc. I gave it 5 stars because it met all my requirements and the screen is absolutely beautiful!

3723,dv1001TU  - Reflective screen. Problems with Display Port for second monitor.,"&nbsp;I got the DV1001TU  model.

Touchscreen laptops usually have reflective screens (like the one on the right in the video that I've uploaded), but this is not even touchscreen. Simply unacceptable screen quality. The product is not returnable; it's replacement only and Amazon makes it a walk through hell, to return this on account of false description.<br><br>Connecting second monitor over USB-C DP does not work; second display as well as the laptop display starts losing signal.

This laptop arrived with a defective battery and even after 3 hours of charging, the battery level remained at 65% when the power cord was removed from supply. Immediately on removing the power cord the laptop shuts down. There is no matter any charge left on the laptop battery which seems to be defective. Never expected such a faulty product from HP. Very pathetic and really disappointed. Could not return it or replace it without booking an inspection appointment. Waiting for them to arrive and inspect it. Never buy HP products as they dont appear to be QC ed properly. Could not give a negative rating so selecting 1 star.<br><br>Edited - The inspection happened 2 days after requesting for replacement. The replacement laptop was approved and ordered. It took another 2 days for Amazon to ship and deliver. However, the delivery person refused to hand over the replacement and accept the defective laptop as he could not power it on!!<br><br>The actual defect was the battery and there was no way he could start it or power on without using the external power cord.<br><br>The delivery person left without accepting the inspected and marked defective laptop.

Later on he agreed to take old product and in case if it gets rejected in the policy he ll take back new laptop. But nothing went wrong so he didn't call me back after.<br><br>2. Please see the images and video. In just 6 months of use I faced display flickering issue. Even though it was under warranty, I had to run to service center for repair. They tried to reinstall OS but it was of no use.

Laptop heats up a lot (incredibly uncomfortable to hold), I think CPU power management tuning is not done properly, did it myself by reading windows documentation, dose not heat up that much now.

3825,Fantastic ultrabook around 63K INR budget.,"I bought this a few days ago, and I am glad I decided to make this purchase. This laptop is probably the only laptop in its segment that boasts such a spec heavy configuration without breaking the bank. The HP pavilion is such a compelling buy and boy does it deliver a premium experience throughout.<br>Having used a Pavilion 15 before, I gravitated towards the Pavilion series predominantly because of the typing experience and the speakers tuned by Bang and Olufsen! They sound mighty impressive for the price! It’s the same experience this time around. The audio is loud and crisp, and typing experience with 2 stage backlit chiclet keys is fantastic! They key travel and feedback is great. This probably is nitpicking, but the only gripe I have is the Power key is placed next to the Delete key. Although, accidentally pressing the power key won't turn off the device or put it to sleep. The 250 Nits IPS panel is crisp and bright for day to day indoor use. The viewing angles are great too with HDR playback support. Although, I would have loved atleast 300 nits plus panel given the price of the device. The chassis seems rigid and built to last! The top cover and the keyboard deck is metal, stays cool to touch as compared to the bottom cover which is plastic. The trackpad is quite large and supports windows gestures. The fingerprint reader is fast and accurate. The laptop remained silent during my entire sessions of document editing and reviewing. However, the fan kicked in during a windows update, and it was loud. The 43Wh cell helps this laptop with a good battery life. The 65-watt barrel pin charger helps in charging the device quickly, and the device can also be charged via PD enabled chargers via the Type-C port. One nifty addition is the HP Quickdrop. It lets users to transfer files back and forth with a companion mobile app. It’s a great addition for me as I can edit photos on Lightroom and quickly share them to my phone to be shared on social media! The i5 11 gen is a beast of a processor and it barely breaks a sweat during photo editing sessions. It can do some light title gaming with the Intel Iris Xe graphics.<br><br>Some closing thoughts:<br>The HP Pavilion with 16Gb RAM and 11th Gen Intel Core i5-1135G7 can be ideal machine for folks wanting a portable yet powerful machine without a hefty sticker price. It is like using a trimmed down version of HP ENVY without compromising on processing power. It has been a fantastic purchase so far!",5.0 out of 5 stars
3826,Very happy with the laptop,"Did a lot of research and landed on this laptop. I am not a gamer and didn't want a gaming laptop or a laptop with a dedicated graphics card. If that's your thing, then probably look elsewhere. Was not able to find this configuration anywhere for this price - 512gb SSD, 16gb RAM with i5 processor. It's an absolute beast. Everything flies and windows is looking so much better now (I was coming from a macbook pro). I was taken a back at how good this thing is. Does all the daily tasks without a sweat. The audio output is also decent (not great). Has a USB C port which can be used for charging (haven't tried this, but someone else had put a detailed review with this feature - check it out).<br><br>One con: If you close the lid and connect it to an external monitor, the wifi speed drops, if you're a bit far from your router. Let me explain: my office room is a bit far away from the router (don't ask me why I set it up like this). I took the laptop there and connected it to my monitor and closed the lid and kept it on a stand. The wifi became very slow. I disconnected the monitor and opened the lid and checked to see that the wifi speed was triple now. Googled and saw that the wifi antennas are below the trackpad - so someone suggested to keep the trackpad part of the laptop on top while placing it on the stand. This helped a bit; in the end, I kept the lid a wee bit open on the stand, and this solved the issue.",5.0 out of 5 stars
3827,One Of the Ideal Laptop for professional or student use.,"I have been using this laptop since August, it's very compact and lightweight. The weight distribution is good but you still cannot open the lid with one hand.<br><br>The screen is okay not the best I have seen but you can perform day to day task very easily.<br><br>Keyboard is quite good, the key travel is nice and the three-level backlight is awesome.<br><br>The battery is same as any slim professional laptop, gives 4-5 hrs battery backup in normal use and definitely this number reduces when heavy tasks are performed.<br><br>Fingerprint accuracy 8.5/10.<br><br>Upgradability is the single ssd that you can swap for more storage and from two- 8gb ram one them is upgradable.<br><br>Conclusion, this laptop is a very good performer in the basic to semi-heavy tasks. Due to lack of dedicated graphics card, games are not as smooth they should be but as a professional this device in one of the best.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Office 2019 is pre-installed and needs only to be activated, so while booting up for the first time it's best to have a mail id ready. the USB type C port is good and I have tested with data transfer only, not display and power output, although according to blogs and forums it will support both.

3943,"At this budget, it’s surely a go-to-device! Powerful!","Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).<br><br>Clarifications/issue points:<br><br>1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.<br>2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.<br>3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.<br>4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.<br>5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)<br>6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.<br>7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.<br>8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>1. Configuration is best at this price level.<br>2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.<br>3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.<br>4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.<br>5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.<br>6. Display is average and gets the job done.<br>7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.<br>8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.<br>9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.<br><br>Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.<br><br>I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4.0 out of 5 stars

3946,High Performance packed in a sleek &amp; thin body,"As soon as I found 11gen Gen i5 at ~62K I got stuck at it &amp; after reading some initial reviews placed an order. Got it at promised time. Here's my review after 3 days.<br><br>Build &amp; Looks are awesome. Very thin &amp; sleek. Silver color adds to the classy looks. HP logo shining at the back further enhances it appearance. 1.4 Kg is not too light &amp; noticeable. People complaining about placement of Power Key button beside delete button but believe me it'll hardly ever come your way. The plastic feels like metal. The screen doesn't lift keyboard. Typing is a pleasure.<br><br>Performance is just awesome. Boots in seconds (5 - 6 sec) &amp; same way it shuts down. Finger print unlock is superfast. Apps opens in no time. Gestures works perfectly. All thanks to 11th Gen i5, 16GB Ram &amp; 512 NvMe SSD.<br><br>Features: Comes with ""Office Home &amp; Student 2019"" (didn't checked is it lifelong). Dropbox 25GB for 1 year also available. Comes with some HP apps &amp; Express VPN as well. HP quick drop helps you transfer files from your phone easily. It has Type C charging point but not sure if it is delivery charging or receiving charging point. Keyboard is backlit with two setting (full &amp; med bright).<br><br>Display: Didn't checked in daylight but at home it is very bright. Watching videos in FHD IPS display is a pleasure.<br><br>Camera is 720p Camera is OK. Pictures &amp; Videos are grainy. I won't be using it much so I'm fine with that.<br><br>Speakers is unbelievably very loud &amp; clear. At 67 its was reaching all across my apartment. Speakers are on the two sides below keyboard.<br><br>Only drawback I noticed was charging pin is too tight to push &amp; pull out.<br><br>I will be posting more updates on performance, battery etc &amp; also my overall experience as I keep using more &amp; more.<br><br>Update after 2 weeks:<br>After lot of research &amp; by doing practical I found that this Laptop can be charged by a Type-C charger. Believe me this is an exclusive piece of information, not many people knows this. HP call center didn't knew this, HP Showroom people don't know this, even when I asked question here someone provided wrong answer. This is an important information they should have mentioned in product detail that this Laptop supports Type C charging. I'm using HP original 65 W Type C power adapter to charge it. Attaching a photo. I did some research myself &amp; found its USB Type C port has Power Delivery (PD) which is bi-directional, so a device can either send or receive power. After reading this I ordered the Type C power adapter &amp; it worked.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Looks delicate overall as compared to much earlier versions<br><br>Overall a decent buy if you use an external keyboard and have a USB Hub .",4.0 out of 5 stars
3951,Indeed the best laptop for Business and Personal Use. Still a decent one for Gaming too.,"I was almost checking several laptops in the price range of 55K - 70K INR and finally took this HP Pavilion 2021 for a great deal. I was initially reluctant in buying this over Lenovo Legion or Ideapad later understood I have done the right thing.<br><br>Coming back to the specs and overall review, just one word this laptop is AMAZING and worth buying. The bootup time is just 3 seconds. Intel Core i7 (11 Gen) is mind-boggling and SSD is an added advantage. The camera quality is convincing and the charging speed is okay. MS office students pack is a worthier inclusion and WIN 11 auto-update is top-notch.<br><br>The only con I felt in this device is a minute and very milder earth shocks observed in the other bezels (owing to the metal bezels) which is bearable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
3952,Good for home use,"The laptop is compact and light. Good bright screen resolution. Perfect size for my requirements for home usage and for my singing.

4060,"Good device, terrible webcam. Value for money.","The only notebook brand in the market offering the latest specs for under 90k. I bought the Core i5 + 512 GB SSD model in April 2021 for about 61k from a recognised HP showroom instead of Amazon. After one and a half months of usage, I can say it's one of the good ones.<br><br>Although the webcam this model has is the worst. It is not 720p HD, it's worse than a low-level VGA webcam. The video and photos are extremely grainy and tinted. I approached HP Care thinking there was an issue with this unit. Turns out it's a universal problem and they wouldn't change the unit because the hardware was fine.<br><br>Sound is pretty good, finish looks premium metal, but is plastic... hopefully durable. It's on the quiet side with respect to fans, which only make noise if you're processing something heavy like updating the BIOS or converting a rather heavy raw video file to MP4. The chiclet keyboard is good, not too creaky and the backlight feature has a dimmer setting too.<br><br>There's a handy-dandy fingerprint scanner, which is smooth and fast with tactile recognition. The display is reasonably good, but not so powerful outside. If you work outdoors a lot, you'd have to put it on full brightness. You probably won't get optimum results even then.<br><br>A little disappointed in HP Care and the declining webcam quality. Given this day and age, there is a need for at least standard quality webcams. However, considering the price and the specs, the notebook is still worth it.<br><br>Pros:<br>- Latest Core i5 processor<br>- 16 GB DDR4 Dual Channel RAM<br>- Lightweight and smooth design<br>- Reasonably good display<br>- Backlit keyboard<br>- Decent battery life ( I got 5-6 hours of heavy use<br>on battery, but that might be different based on what applications you're using)<br>- Good audio<br>- Intel Iris Xe graphics are really good. You don't need an extra graphic card unless you're into hardcore video editing, 3D modelling or design or<br>heavy gaming.<br>- Expandable SSD storage<br>- Fingerprint reader<br><br>Cons:<br>- Terrible webcam quality<br>- Metallic finish, plastic build<br>- Screen hinges aren't the most flexible<br>- Number of ports - 2 USB, 1 HDMI, 1 USB Type C, 1 MicroSD reader slot (as opposed to a full or mini SD slot, which makes it a bit difficult for DSLR users)<br>- Only 512 GB of SSD storage<br>- Colour - only Natural Silver, surface prone to scratches.<br><br>Will update if I notice anything else.

4064,"Best, Fantastic, Amazed with the Quality and Performance","I researched a lot before buying this. There were two major things for my research -<br>1) Should I go for Chromebook (I earlier having 11 inch android tablet)?.<br>2) Should I go for HP as my first chromebook?<br><br>I was having Lenovo P11 table, which disappointed a lot, with its performance. So I excluded lenovo as my first chromebook branch.<br><br>Asus I excluded after reading  a lot of review with issues on touch and speed.<br>Next I checked Amazon and Flipkart ""Refurbished"" store, to check which items are more listed there, so I excluded all those brands and models. Because the products users are returning, that I don't want to buy.<br><br>So after all filters, I went for this HP chromebook. I am using HP laptop from last 5 years, and still its performance and battery is working fine.<br><br>This chromebook is best for skype calling/meeting. Speaker is enough loud, and microphones are fantastic. Other party will hear loud and clear voice of yours.<br><br>Touch screen is working exactly in same quality compared to a costly smartphone.<br><br>Battery backup is 10-11 hours, when my skype is alwasy ON, Screen is always ON, VLC player is ON with small screen, showing my outdoor camera video.

4069,Decent enough at this price range for a multitasking laptop,"The package arrived on time with one-day delivery. It was properly sealed. Kudos for that.<br><br>Chromebooks are essentially giant Android laptops with the Chrome OS and desktop style multitasking. Here are a few features on which it delivers depending on my use case:<br><br>PROs:<br><br>1. OS: At the price range of 25k, it's impossible to find a good Windows laptop. Chrome OS works way better with minimal lag. The only decent tablet around this price point is the iPad 9, which is a great device but iPadOS doesn't offer desktop like functionality.<br>2. File transfer and charging: It takes around 1.5 - 2 hrs. depending on usage to fully charge. It also gives great battery life of 8 -10 hrs. No external USB ports are required for connecting pendrives and external HDDs (unless you require a card reader).",5.0 out of 5 stars

Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle.  Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen.

This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.<br><br>Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates.

Intall big stuff there and work on either of your devices per your mobility needs. Like installing DB on desktop and doing development on this laptop.<br>5. Heavy multi tasking is not recommended i.e. keeping many applications running in taskbar must be avoided. Plan your work and divide and concur.

4262,Good device if you know how to use it,"DECENTLY FAST LAPTOP ONCE YOU SET IT UP!<br>First: Once you start it after unboxing and set up the windows, it will perform slow for a bit. Don't worry. Go into settings, windows update, and download all updates &amp; restart to install the downloaded updates. This will take some time. Be patient.<br>Second: When all windows updates are installed and the OS is upto date, for the time being, uninstall bloatwares like Prime video, Instagram, WhatsApp, xbox etc. Clean it up as much as possible by removing unnecessary apps. Set up McAfee Live Safe by opening it up from app tray.<br>Third: Most importantly, this machine comes with Windows S mode i.e. you can only download apps from MS Store. If you want a decently fast machine, stay in the S mode. Forget Chrome, use Edge browser built in. Its based on chromium only. If you want to slow the machine down, Google how to get out of S mode.<br><br>Conclusion: For the price (similar to a chromebook) it is a good laptop for browsing on Edge browser, YouTube, Netflix, Prime video, MS office, MS Teams, Zoom etc. All this can be done in S mode smoothly.<br><br>Update: At this price point, the keyboard is of really good quality.

4381,A great laptop if you know how ...,"Do you know how many laptops have dual drive? Hardly any. Most of the high end i5s and Rizens come with a single M.2 interface and you are stuck with the factory given SSD of measly 256 GB or 512 GB space. Now you'll say I can buy a larger capacity SSD. OK, what's the cost of a 2 TB NVME? At least 16K and what happens to the older nvme stick?. This is why I always buy laptops with dual drives and this laptop has it. You can have<br>- One nvme m.2 drive<br>- One regular SATA3 interface HDD or SSD<br><br>With the above option, you can have a 512 GB SSD (3.5K INR for Crucial) with 1 TB HDD allowing you to store all your songs, movies etc. and YET have the FULL speed of an SSD based system.<br><br>Though I did not purchase this laptop at Amazon, I bought it from a local store for 1K higher price, after initial start I noticed how SLOW everything was. In fact even my laptop 15 years older is a lot faster. In any case I never intended to use the default HDD but I was curious to know HOW slow it could be after reading everyone's reviews - YES it is SUPER SLOW.<br><br>Then I stuffed in a P1 500GB NVME SSD and re-installed Windows 11 and the performance was mind-blowing - actually not really mind blowing because I have been using high perf laptops for quite some time - the minimum RAM any of my laptops have is 20 GB minimum. Now this laptop comes with 8 GB of RAM, but I found Windows 11 to be quite responsive and snappy for all basic work like YouTube, browsing, Discord, listening to music and the likes. I can always replace the 4 GB RAM stick with a 16 GB RAM stick to have a total RAM of 20 GB which is pretty good.<br><br>In case anyone wants to know how to re-install Windows 11 on an SSD read on..<br>1. Start your new laptop, register Windows 11 etc. Ensure you note down the Microsoft account that you use to register. Also search the Internet on how to print your Windows 11 CD Key, this is a command run in the command prompt, you can write down the CD key or mail the CD key to yourself.<br>2. Search for ""download windows 11 media creation tool"" and go to the Microsoft site which comes up in the search hits<br>3. Select the second option of ""Create Windows 11 Installation Media"". This will download a tool which you need to run.<br>4. You will need to have a USB Pen Drive of at least 8 GB capacity.<br>5. When you run the downloaded program, it will ask you to confirm if the Windows Installer should be created on the attach USB Pen drive, confirm this.<br>6. Depending on your internet connection speed this process will complete in 10-15 minutes.<br>7. You now need to go to the ""Settings App"" -&gt; Select ""Recovery"" -&gt; Select ""Advanced Startup"" . OR keep the SHIFT button down when clicking the ""RESTART"" button.<br>8. The computer will reboot but instead of going directly into Windows, select to boot from attached device. Now Windows Installer will load from the USB drive and you can install Windows 11 completely fresh. Note: during installation you should select 'Advanced' and select to install Windows on the new HDD (SSD). The installation usually completes in 15 minutes, YES, SSD makes it THAT fast. I would advise against deleting the existing Windows 11 partitions that are present in the original HDD (just in case). You can always format the HDD after Windows 11 has been successfully installed on the new SSD.<br>9. You'll have to again enter details like the PC name etc. Ensure you use the SAME Microsoft account to register your copy of Windows 11, it will auto-activate. In case registration fails, you can always use the CD KEY you printed in the first step to activate Windows 11.<br>10. Once Windows 11 is fully installed using the laptop will be a totally different experience.<br><br>Anyway, those of you who already purchased this laptop, you made a great choice, if you want the same performance as other laptops, I strongly advise you to do a fresh install of Windows 11 or even Windows 10, this ensure NO additional software is installed which vendors always install for marketing, data collection purposed, all these useless software only make your computer slow.<br><br>-- all the best --",5.0 out of 5 stars
4382,Value for money,"This is a good product at this economical price range. intially it would be slow and disappoint us. However after reading the reviews i updated to evm SSD by giving this to a computer technician. After installing the SSD a partition is made to various local disks like D ,E,F and G .

Even the simplest of videos lag very much and HD videos get stuck all the time. Videos of HD+ resolution i.e more than 1080p always hangs in the worst possible way. This piece just loves to hang and is always in hanging mode, can't even use 2 apps simultaneously bcoz of the weak processor, battery drains out within 15-20 mins of full charge. No game i repeat no game ever runs on it even if u run it with low specs. Can't even do simple tasks bcoz it gets stuck for hours and continues lagging.

The item arrives in sturdy packaging which prevents it from damage during transit. I myself use this laptop for university online meetings. This laptop is not meant for high graphics gaming, low-resolution games are compatible. Rest assured is fine.<br><br>Benefits:<br>- Heat: No heating issue. While charging only the charging adapter and battery gets warm which is quite normal.<br>- Charging time: Gets charged in 2hr 30mn (0-100). Playback time (normal usage)- 4 hrs.<br>- Boot time: 10 secs switch-on &amp; switch-off.<br>- Writing speed: USB 3.0 (output to input) gives 80-120 Mbps writing speed.<br>- Display: FHD display, Antiglare display lets you stream Netflix, Youtube &amp; many more from any angle of the laptop.<br>- Sound: Based on a laptop system, the sound is quite good. I hear music at volume 40/100.<br>- Touchpad: smooth.<br>- Pre-activated Office 2019.<br><br>Note:<br>- Purchase a Saco silicon keyboard cover (black) as the visibility of the default key prints in daylight are not so efficiently visible.<br><br>- As shown in picture, the laptop must be kept above any plain hard surface so that the air circulation keeps running and does not gets heated.<br><br>- In many reviews, you will find that the laptop is getting heated, the worst laptop and all. But one must know how to use it properly.<br><br>- At first, I was thinking of purchasing the same model only with Ryzen 3 4300U processor. But I changed my decision and stuck to this only. Because as compared to 4300U, in this laptop 3250U one gets 15.6 Screen, RJ-45 Port, 1TB HDD, calculator keyboard.<br><br>- Don't confuse yourself with the processors, someone will say quad-core is better than dual-core, and don't purchase this laptop as it is dual-core. But trust me for home and student basic usage, this laptop is more than enough.<br><br>- If one plays a game or performs multi-high tasking software, then the laptop fan runs at high speed which is a bit noisy. But don't worry its normal only.<br><br>- DDR4 2400 mghz is sufficient for a student and basic office meetings use.<br><br>- Do check the warranty on HP's official website by entering the serial number which is present at the laptop base or product box.<br><br>That's all folks!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
4775,Very good laptop but...,"This laptop is best in this segment, it's top in every parameter like boot speed, multitasking, sound quality, battry life everything is perfect,  but the only problem is ITS COOLING FAN IS NOISY..it create considerable noise specialy on multitasking",5.0 out of 5 stars

The laptop handles it like a charm.<br><br>Unhappy with Amazon and it's back end teams' inefficiency.

4790,Really impressive!,"&nbsp;This is one of the best if not the best Laptop I have laid my hands on under the 45k range. It is usually priced 38-43k depending on the current market prices.<br>The Keyboard is really tacky and feels really good and typing is going to be smooth. The keyboard is really good. Mechanical Keyboard vibes. The Keyboard is not BACKLIT.<br><br>The Display is an IPS one and has that typical IPS clarity and sharp colours to it, I have definately seen better IPS displays but in this price range this IPS display might be the best.<br><br>The performance of this Laptop is really impressive, although you only get single channel 8GB 2400mhz RAM(Only 5.9 GB usable) . All in all a best Laptop for student/teacher use. Light gaming will be OK but don't expect hardcore gaming.<br><br>The speaker is really impressive and loud, this is the best one I have come across. It will put some premium laptop speakers to shame. Really good.<br><br>The Body is typical HP chassy since last 3 generations nothing new here.<br><br>Pros:-<br>Really good performance for price.<br>Excellent speaker.<br>Excellent Display.<br>Keyboard is typical HP, really good.<br>Came with WIN 11 pre installed.<br><br>Cons:-<br>Felt ports option could have been better.<br>Felt that the 8GB 2400mhz ram gonna hold it back, if it was faster it would have been better.<br>The camera isn't that impressive either but will do the job.<br><br>If you are a student, go for it.

4802,"Value for money, best in budget","&nbsp;It's just amazing! Let me get the details here:<br><br>At this price it will be the best buy for office/casual use, average gaming (Haven't played any high res games yet).<br><br>• It has 1 SSD 256GB and 1 HDD of 1TB. Windows is<br><br>installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds. Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.<br><br>• It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive. Honestly, I don't think anyone use any CD these days. If you use disk then you need to get a usb disk drive. Everything is pre-installed. Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 19' so you can use it right<br><br>away! • It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.<br><br>In short, as I said, at this price this is the best.

I searched for many laptops in this price range but did not find many who were offering the SSD+HDD combination with 8GB RAM and preinstalled windows and office softwares. I am using the Ryzen based system for the 1st time. The configuration offered in this price range is really great.<br>I am using this laptop for a week now and mostly do normal computing activities, web browsing, watching movies etc. The booting up and shutting down are really fast...around 20 secs. The sound, display and battery backup are also good. The laptop is new now and lets see how things go with time. I think it is really worth buying this product and will recommend it.<br>If it is helpful, I would like to mention one more point that while buying I had opted for exchanging my old laptop  to get some discount... amazon was offering 9.75K flat discount.  But since my old laptop was damaged a little in the hinge area and the laptop plastic body, the exchange offer got cancelled totally later during pick up.",5.0 out of 5 stars

After the initial setup of windows and all, I had shutdown and booted the system again. Within 5-6 seconds after pressing the power button, login screen came up. This is the fastest boot I have ever seen on a laptop. 1TB drive is dedicatedly for storage. 256gb SSD drive is only for the OS, which is good. Due to SSD, laptop boot time is lightening fast.

4900,Good at this price,It's only dual core so if you like to play games you won't be able to enjoy with smoothness. By adding 4-5k you can go for ryzen 5 or i5 processor. Booting is very fast. Display is good. Battery is also good. Kepad is the main issue. It is very faintly printed so in daylight you might find diffucties some time. It also doesn't have the keypad lights for night use. Rest of the features are good.<br>For normal student use its good laptop. However if you play games then if you should go for ryzen 5 or i5 which will have hexa core processor.,4.0 out of 5 stars
4901,Mind-blowing purchase,"It's just amazing! Let me get the details here:<br><br>• At this price it will be the best buy for office/casual use, average gaming (Haven't played any high res games yet).<br>• It has 1 SSD 256GB and 1 HDD of 1TB. Windows is installed in SSD so the loading time (from turned off to start) is near about 5-7 seconds.<br>• Usable Ram is around 5.86GB. 8GB is installed in one slot so another one is free to get another ram installed.<br>• It is very light. It doesn't have a CD drive. Honestly, I don't think anyone use any CD these days. If you use disk then you need to get a usb disk drive.<br>• Everything is pre-installed. Windows (of course), all the drivers update, Office 20' so you can use it right away!<br>• It doesn't have a keyboard backlight.<br><br>In short, as I said, at this price this is the best. Trust me, I investigated on Croma, HP world etc. to see if I get any better model (HP) at this price but I failed.",4.0 out of 5 stars

4905,Pretty good,"It has been 3 months since it arrived and I am quite happy with it. I mainly use it for browsing, MS office, streaming, Zoom calls, Some wordpress web designing...so not that heavy an use. But the processor is more than adequate to handle the jobs that I mentioned. At 8 gb ram, utilisation for the about mentioned tasks is around 70%. No heating issues. Build is solid and premium looking and the internal speakers are pretty good. I had a Dell laptop before this n its speakers wasn't this good. Battery lasts about 6 hrs. Only thing is when connected to external speakers, the sound is not evenly distributed. I mean the left speaker is slightly louder than the right. It wasn't like this with my previous laptop. Display is very good. It boots n shuts down very fast. I don't know about the camera coz I don't have a frame of reference but when I tested just for the sake of it, it seemed ok. Overall, I think it is a good laptop for the above mentioned purposes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
4906,Good with configuration and price tag,"I am giving review after using this laptop for 6 months. Overall is really good as we do get SSD and HDD on certain price range that is really good. I have not face any major issue with it till now. I haven't played much gaming in it but does do bit good(checked in Asphalt 8). You will feel bit lag in case of using heavy coding software's. Multimedia experience is awesome and speakers are good enough.<br><br>Few things aren't as per the mark<br>1. Booting is quick but shutdown process is slow,<br>2. Adaptor is really and quickly getting heated and sometimes minor heating in a battery too.<br>3. Screen camera quality is really poor.<br><br>Overall as per my need I am satisfied with product and giving 4 star cause Camera and Minor heating issue.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5011,Pathetic Buying Experience 🤦‍♂️,"Model-Acer Aspire 5,i5-11th Gen,8gb,Iris XE Graphics<br>To start with my review, Delivery Time of Laptop was really Quick. Kudos to Amazon Team for that. But there were two issues. Firstly The day when Laptop was supposed to come, Laptop didn't come because it was sent to other are of city. So it got delayed for a day. Secondly,the Delivery Person who was also the person for inspection of my precious laptop exchange was utter Arrogant and was pointing at non existing problems with my old laptop. He didn't even have basic knowledge of Hardware and Software of Laptops and still Amazon had sent this incompetent person for inspection and Laptop pick up. Had to talk with his senior for the delivery of new laptop.<br>Now Coming to laptop,the first 3 days laptop ran really Smoothly. It had no problems whatsoever with any softwares at all. But suddenly one day it wasn't showing any Wifi. The wifi symbol in taskbar was gone. Even in Network settings Wifi wasn't visible. I did Troubleshooting and also checked for Wifi drivers. Wifi driver wasnt at all visible. And Troubleshooting didn't help at all. Now Laptop is frozen at this state and isn't going ahead. I don't know whether it's Software problem or Hardware fault but this is worst experience even after spending Hefty Amount of Money 🤦‍♂️.<br>Hence I would say don't buy laptops from Amazon. Rather buy them from Company's Official Store and Website. And I would add avoid Acer Laptop and rather buy HP Laptops as after sells services are far better and experience is also better.<br>Pretty pathetic experience 🤦‍♂️<br>I think I've bought Headache after buying this Laptop 🤦‍♂️",2.0 out of 5 stars

5248,Camera sucks in real life,Please avoid this phone if your looking for a good camera phone within 25-30k range. The camera is good in outdoor light and only the main camera works well.

5257,Won't last long. Be prepared for repairs.,"Poor build quality. Plastic back and plastic frame too. For every day use, this phone will not even last 2 years. Two major concerns that make this phone non-durable are:<br><br>1) Heat is an enemy for batteries and for every component in the phone. This phone has two batteries sandwiched together for fast charging in parallel. The batteries are stacked up which is the reason for the thickness. Moreover the phone is targeted at heavy users who run intense applications / gaming etc which generate lot of heat. 144 Hz refresh rate generates heat and drains battery quicker which often brings up the need for fast charging. Fast charging generates heat too. Unfortunately, the entire phone is enclosed in plastic casing. There is absolutely no scope for heat dissipation. The temperature inside the phone would be lot higher than what we feel.<br><br>2) No strength in the frame because the frame is plastic too. A metal frame could have withstood pressure on the phone and could have prevented bends and deformation. Its very highly likely that the phone deforms when carried in pocket or when some pressure gets applied involuntarily. The glue holding the back and frame will give up under heat which makes it even more prone for bends.<br>The risk of batteries catching fire is higher. Heat causes batteries puff and lack of strength in the frame puts pressure directly on the batteries. I would be surprised if this phone lasts more than 2 years for a daily user.<br><br>For me, this is a secondary phone which I use occasionally for running multiple apps in parallel (not gaming). It sits at home 90% of the time. I needed a phone which has processing power with 8GB RAM/256GB memory. With discounts I got it for Rs.20,000 with exchange. I am aware of the limitations of this phone prior to the purchase. If you need a phone for everyday use, you should avoid this. Certainly, the asking price of Rs.29,000 does not justify the poor build quality. Had Xiaomi given it a metal frame, I would have absolutely given it 5 star rating.",3.0 out of 5 stars
5258,Not as per expected,I was earlier using poco F1. It's been 9 days using this phone.<br>Camera quality is not good. Hope they will fix in updates<br>Charging time is approx 01 hours from 10 to 100 .

There are no heating issues<br>A decent camera but not really good for low-lighting.<br>Dimensity 8100 is amazing at this price range.<br>A super cool display will save power and experience a 144 HZ refresh rate.<br><br>Then Why I don't like this phone?<br>UI is full of bugs - though it has a powerful processor these bugs will crash the app and you have to reopen it.<br>No dark theme - even though you apply a dark theme, it won't reflect in any app except google apps like Youtube/chrome.<br>Only google dialer is available so if you press the call record button, there will be an announcement and no solution for that.<br><br>USB Debugging showing error and I am waiting for a technician to visit.<br><br>Conclusion: Awesome hardware integrated with the worst software -MIUI 13<br>Don't buy this phone now,  let them fix all the software issues.

Oh! How wrong I was. Display should be least of ones concerns. In fact I think display is one of the best feature on the phone.<br><br>I don't use the phone extensively. Battery life is very poor. I charged my phone fully but did not use it for 1.5 days but battery was discharged to 50% with internet and wifi turned off. That speaks volumes.<br><br>Finger print sensor, unlock and display functions are smooth and feels fast. I set the refresh rate at 90hz.<br><br>Front camera is not good. Primary camera is good enough. You have various modes and effects to choose from. Picture clarity is satisfactory. Could have been better but no complaints considering the price range.<br><br>This processor should support high graphics games. I have not played any game on it. Not experienced any heating issues. Not faced any issues with wifi Or network. Good job on that 👍.<br><br>Mi phones always let's user customize at various aspects of UI, themes and effects. Various free fonts to choose from. Very few junk apps. Most of the Preinstalled apps can be deleted. I appreciate that.<br><br>You can also block the Ads. Be sure to block the ads during initial set up.<br><br>I don't like the Speakers. Sound isn't loud enough. I was expecting a better performance. 3.5mm jack is a plus.<br><br>67W fast charging is just as advertised. They provide a 67W adaptor with USB cable.

5495,Most powerful phone under 25k,"Bought this almost a month ago , Got it for 15250/- with exchange and cards. And I am absolutely satisfied with this phone. It is undoubtedly most powerful phone in this range. Camera is decent (not the best). Beast performance and 3.5 mm jack available so its best for those who do gaming. Other day to day tasks run smoothly. Some bugs are in OS which can be fixed with updates. Screen is LCD but its good quality LCD with 144 hz refresh rate so it is overall decent although Amoled with 120 hz could have been better. Audio is good with dual stereo speakers present. Fingerprint sensor is quick. Battery backup is good and 67W charging is also fast enough. I am a heavy user and even for me it gives backup for whole day so Battery is overall very good. 4.5/5 phone. If performance matters for You. If camera is more important to you go for Realme 9 pro+ 5g.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5496,Awesome performance,"It's been couple of days using it...the performance is superb...no lag...i can't imagine how people live with slow and lagging phones now....this is how a ideal device should be made off..!! Hatsoff to performance and gaming is just a game for this and not heavy task at all...<br><br>One BIG FLAW, i don't understand what's the problem with RAM management. I have 8 GB variant with 3 gb extension so it's 11 gb...but here even when 80% ram is not utilized the app refreshes when switched back to...like after adding filters on Amazon you are checking some items and then you got to switch another app for some work and when again you come back...then hell all filters gone...dun know if it's problem with AMAZON APP or MI RAM Management...i have damn 6gb ram in spare still app refreshes and it irritates to again add on tne filters.... whomever is responsible pls work on it....i don't think so session timeout is 1 mins...cmn...!!<br>Also even if you are prime user and paying with icici Amazon credit card...there's no cashback for you here....beaware...!!<br><br>Camera is much more than i expected...i mean rear....you should not expect good from front....<br><br>Overall too good exp....!!

5497,Best in it's segment,"This is best in its segment just gone through many reviews saying bad about its camera and battery just because of this cancelled it 2 times but finally bought it, Here are my review about this:<br>1) ""About it's battery"" Many says it's battery is draining fast but seriously saying I have started at 98% and taken classes continously for 7hrs and 53% battery was remaining. I don't know what other's want, but for me it is enough.<br>2) ""Its camera"" It is good, but can be optimised more by a software update. It is not like you can't use it, it is good but needs a bit of more optimisation .<br>3) ""It's display "" It was a big consideration for me as it is not amoled which we get on other's in this price segment, but trust me it is far better than any other ips display and 144hz display will heal all the marks.<br>4) ""Its Processor"" We get a flagship grade Dimensity 8100 processor which we se on the phones which are priced 50% more than this. That's why amoled is not there.<br>5) It's lpddr5 ram and ufs 3.1 storage is very fast I am attaching the antutu and Geekbench scores.<br>6) ""About it's plastic back""  It completely depends upon your choice, it's plastic back is of high quality, in glass if get cracked you have to pay 3k to 4k for repair while in plastic it's only around 1k to 1.5k.<br>""At last this review is based on my usage it may vary depending upon your usage"".",5.0 out of 5 stars
5498,Top Notch Best gaming phone in this segment,"The Dimensity 8100 is super.😱😱😱😱😱😱😱<br>I was fond of Snapdragon processors because they have good processing power and i used to hate Mediatek for so many issues. but in this phone with Dim.8100 the phone's performance is so good with<br>Constant 60fps in games,<br>No fps drop and lags in any game,<br>Give 90fps in some games.<br><br>No heating is the best feature. 😍<br>Battery backup is decent in my opinion.<br>In games you can play 4-5 hrs with 60fps.<br><br>If you are fond of gamming this phone is perfect for you. 👍👍<br><br>Drawbacks are FFS display (works for me i dont like Amoled) and not that much good camera ( also works for me because i have an iPhone also)...",5.0 out of 5 stars
5499,New Budget king!!!!! U should go for it..,"I was very confused with this phone.. as I was looking for nothing phone 1 .. but after looking at QC issues with nothing I felt disappointed .. then I got attracted to specs of K50i, from processor to all the hardware including storage, bt, wifi, battery I was convinced enough to go for it... Was very skeptical for buying this smartphone as I kept very low expectations with display..<br>Now its been 1 week using k50i..<br>Here short summery:<br><br>Display: buttery smooth 144hz, if ips and amoled gets married this will be son kind of display..<br>Battery: perfect with heavy usage and 67w charging is usefull enough in rush time.. gets full charged in 30 min if battery is at 30-40%..<br>Performance: Dimensity 8100 is a flagship processor, very smooth performance with no lag or gitter..<br>Os:  MIUI 13 is pretty well managed and trust me i didn't receive any irritation app suggestions and faltu adds.. its very clean.. u can uninstall any system app as well... feels very smooth now after managing all that..<br>Storage: ups 3.1 is damn goood with managing storage.. RAM management is very good u can mana multiple apps.. at the same time.<br>Extra Features:  There are lots of extra features u r getting in this .. which u will get in any flagship smartphone..<br>Back doble/tripple tap action<br>Floating window and smooth multitasking..<br>3.5 MM jack is something like breath of fresh air.. I prefer over bt.. and trust me DAC used in this device is damn amazing.. u can't get any better hp output in any other midrange phone..<br>Design:  The overall housing and camera placing is just awesome, it looks pretty premium design..<br>Slight curves makes this phone very handy. U can use skins to make it look more premium.<br><br>Final verdict:  If u are having budget 20k-25k want performance centric phone with 3.5 mm jack just go for this..<br>Trust me this is bang for buck deal!",5.0 out of 5 stars
5500,Truly value for money and thanks to amazing Amazon.,"Bought this Redmi K50i exchanging my Realme 3 pro at just ₹16000 . If you want to exchange your mobile Amazon is the only platform where you get the most value. Flipkart is doing poor business and harassing the customers in the name of Big Billion Days!<br>Now coming to Redmi K50i mobile, if you are looking for a solid processor, Long battery life, fast charging and refresh rate, gaming mobile then Redmi K50i will be your automatic choice. Camera quality is ok, Selfie camera is not up to the mark. Display is nice but AMOLED can't be replaced. Overall it is a very useful smart phone for regular uses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5501,Good phone with this price range,I am giving this review after 3 months use.<br><br>Pros:<br>Battery life is good will last full day with full charge with heavy use.<br>No heating and lag issue.<br>Performance is grt.<br>Not much weight.<br>Speker and Mic is well.<br>Cons:<br>Camera day light is perfect but some low light condition not performing well. Colour are faded and pics are faded.<br>Most disadvantages is no image stabilisation is there. Video skahes a lot while shooting.<br>Memory management also great cons here.<br>Like if you switch app the previous aap start again not resume where you were.,5.0 out of 5 stars
5502,Excellent Phone with little compramises,Excellent Phone but they need to work in the are of front camera.its really bad.My redmy note 7 pro camera is better than redmi K50i.Otherwise it would be awesome phone.Even lcd screen is as good as amoled.I feel they have worked on it.I hope they will sort it out in coming days the issue of front camera I am talking about.<br>I am giving 4 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars
5503,My review after 1 week,"Everything is good in this phone, I thought 5080 maH battery would be more than enough for me but  the battery is discharging very fast though I'm not a heavy user.. but 67W charger gets the job done.

5508,Nothing like this in this price range,"I don't understand why there are a lot of negative reviews about this phone but I found it value for money.<br>First of all smartphone prices have increased from last year and flagships are not providing everything we need. So we need to compromise for something to get another thing.<br>After using it for 15-20 days<br><br>first, lets see the cons:<br>it has no proximity sensor so it's a bit hard for the screen to turn off during calls. But it does manage to do it right almost all the time with software and other sensors present on the phone to detect if the phone is near the ear.<br>This phone has no NFC. I wanted it so bad but unfortunately, nope it has no NFC.<br>The software is a little buggy(minor here and there bugs). But I'm sure MIUI will optimize it within a few months. I'm a custom ROM user so I don't care much about it.<br>IP53 water resistance. This should've been a little better.<br><br>Pros:<br>People might complain about it being LCD. I've never used Oled so I might not know how good OLED panel looks. But this thing dint disappoint me. 144hz is really smooth.<br>It has Dolby vision+, HDR10+ and brightness is okayishh under direct sun. Not too good or good but definitely not bad.<br>Battery backup you will get 8 hours of screen time. with normal usage(Youtube, WhatsApp, etc)  and with 120hz refresh rate.<br>charging speed 40 min to 1 hour at idle state.<br>and the biggest thing is you get Mediatek8100. There is literally no phone offering this chip under 25k<br>literally, everyone with this chip is above 30k.<br>and the best thing is you get a headphone jack, IR Blaster, and Stereo speakers.<br>Alternatives for this phone might be poco f4 and neo 6 but they are not under 25k so i would not consider them as a fair comparison.",5.0 out of 5 stars
5509,Performance Beast!!,"More negative reviews because of ""paying less than 22k and expecting more than 35k.""<br><br>Pros:<br>-Firstly processor is a beast in this price, fantastic performance.<br>-Display is really good though it is a LCD panel.<br>-144 refresh rate is butter smooth.<br>-Dolby vision and atmos good, stero speakers sound good.<br>-3.5 mm Headphone jack is icing the cake.<br>-Charging speed is ok.<br>-Liquid cool system is working good, phone doesn't heat.<br>-This is one of the best miui ( very less bloatware, you can easily uninstall, no bugs so far)<br>-Haptics, fingerprint sensor, build quality, call &amp; video quality, signal reception and other features are good.<br><br>Cons:<br>-First con is battery.. Which drains fast comparatively other phones (but 5080 battery lasts a day easily)<br>-Camera is not upto mark especially front cam.<br>-If it is AMOLED, it could have been better(but in this price they provided best LCD display)<br>-Ram management is really poor.. Especially amazon app.<br><br>I hope an update may solve most of the cons(waiting for that hopefully😃😃)<br><br>Verdict: If you are camera centric and fan of super amoled you will disappoint.

5510,Great phone but a little expensive,"Found it a bit costly than the other alternatives as it comes with only 6GB RAM however this is among the handful of phones that provide a 3.5 mm headphone jack.

Heating is there when gaming for long hours however nothing too drastic or alarming<br>3. Side mounted fingerprint sensor is great, takes very less time to unlock the phone<br>4. Battery is enough to go through the whole day and still have 40% or more for the next day<br>5. Charging is also fast for a battery this size<br>6. 3.5 mm Headphone jack is provided<br>7. UI experience (MIUI 13) is good as well and allows lot of customisation, although some took some time getting used to the new style of notification panel<br>8. Comes with phone case and screen protector<br>Cons-<br>1. The camera is average and nothing to boast about, specially in low-light conditions<br>2.

Actually I exchanged my 3years old OPPO A53 mobile for 13k including bonus offers in Amazon after that I bought k50i for 13k. Amazon Exchange is very good he just checked for my IMEI number and it was done . So I got very much lucky to buy this easy way and it was best Budget Flagship Phone.

5581,Best in this price,I exchanged my 3 year old Realme X (bought for 20k) in Sale for nearly 8k and obtained additional credit offer of 3k. So bought this 8GB (+3GB) with 256 GB veriant at leas than 18k which for me was a super deal. Though it has no Amoled Display but the quality of display is too good. It has a lot of additional features. I think this flagship of Redmi K series is worth for its pricing compared to specifications provided by its competitors. The only drawback on paper is 'No Amoled Display'.<br>I will rate this 9/10. Redmi should have provided Amoled Display.But honestly I found the the quality of display is superb for Netflix and prime videos.,5.0 out of 5 stars

There is only one major bug ram management which will be optimized in the future by MIUI updates. And if you're thinking about using custom ROM in the future this phone will be beast with AOSP so you can ignore any MIUI bugs for now. Make sure there are some MIUI-related bugs like front camera quality, battery backup, multi-tasking, etc as MIUI is not optimized currently for this device. At this price, we can't expect more than this.",5.0 out of 5 stars

5613,This is a bang for your buck device.,"It's a good phone for the price. I brought this phone on the first day of the sale I have been using this for just over week this will be my first impression &amp; will post in detail in the coming weeks.<br>1. Build Quality - Its very light due to complete plastic build but it's not cheap &amp; has a nice fit there are no squeaks or creaks when pressed.<br>2. Display - The LCD is very very good but do not compare it AMOLED, especially AMOLED displays from a high-end devices they  have superior colors &amp; deep blacks but if are upgrading from an old LCD or a midrange/low end device with LED display believe me it's much better coupled with it's high refresh rates which are manually adjustable gives options of 60/90/144 Hz helps to conserve battery. You consider it as the best LCD display on a phone.<br>3. Camera - I'm not an expert, the main camera adequate &amp; is on par with other competitors the ultra wide &amp; selfie cameras needs color optimization the night mode is mediocre at best, at this price it's acceptable &amp; for a normal user is more than enough.<br>4. Performance - It's very good day to day usage is a breeze no lags or stutters, I only pay call of duty mobile MP mode played for 2hrs no lag/stutter in low, medium &amp; high settings but at highest graphic settings there are occasional frame drops when there is a lot to render like (smoke, fire &amp; explosions all together) I usually play on medium graphics. I believe further gaming optimization is required. At least for now there are no competitors in terms of price to performance to this device. The 2hr COD gaming session drained about 35-45% of battery &amp; it dose not heat up at all, at the very worst it's warm to the touch that is the icing on the cake.<br>5. Battery - It has a good battery life it can last you 1.5 days without any problem  if you are a moderate user. The charger in the box will charge your phone in 45 minutes which is good enough.<br>6. Connectivity - it has good call quality &amp; wifi connectivity is good no problems here.<br>7. Software - The standard MIUI shenanigan we have to be careful while setting up the phone to avoid Ads but there are no major bugs for now &amp; UI optimization is very good hence no lag/stutter in day to day use.<br>8. Sound - People don't mention how good the dac in this phone is I use it with KZ Crinacle &amp; it's awesome.<br>In short if you can get this phone that punches above it's weight, If you can get it at a good price with exchange &amp; card offers it's a steal.<br><br>Just an update after having used it for about a month.<br>1. Most thing stated in the initial impression still holds true.<br>2. Camera needs to be optimized, it's really bad especially in dark environment.<br>3. There are couple of minor bugs in the UI but it will not effect the day to day usage.<br>4. Battery life is excellent. I've seen people giving a bad review stating that it has a bad battery life I believe they are  uninformed  a phone with near flagship processing power giving about 7 hrs of SOT is very good it's  actual competitors with SD888 barely gives 6 hrs of SOT, I have seen people comparing it with low end devices with SD 720/SD750 &amp; Dimensity 800/700 these have about half the processing power as 8100.<br>5. The sound quality from the 3.5 mm jack is awesome Xiaomi has used a high quality DAC if you have a good IEM it's really enjoyable.<br><br>Conclusion - It's great device, but for those who are looking for top of the line processor (for gaming)under tight budget. If you consume a lot of content (Netflix etc) there are other devices with better display for the same price &amp; this device is not for photography it has a really mediocre camera.<br>But if you can get at a good price by using bank &amp; exchange offers (under 20K)you can easily go for it. I got it for Rs16250 which is a steal.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5614,Looks are Deceiving ...,"Got this as my secondary smartphone as I am a very heavy user.<br>There are just 3 things that i would like to say about this device as i guess everyone has done their research about it before purchasing it.<br><br>1.) Performance is great &amp; the battery life is good too as the SoC is efficient. At this price, have no second thoughts if these 2 things are your priorities. Go for it.<br><br>2.) Cameras, Design, Build  : Not something to be very highly praised.Expect Average to Good pics from the stock Camera app. Gcam is still not optimised but you can get better night shots &amp; better sharpness with HDR+ in shots if you get a stable version. i tried 10 versions of it.<br>Design &amp; Build quality is alright. Not premium in this price range. As it's my secondary device wasn't looking for it either way. it'll do the job however.<br><br>3. ) Its not what it seems to be :<br>I was more worried about its LCD Panel rather than its Amoled Panel. Turns out it's not that big of a deal in real life. Yes, contrast is something you'll miss especially the blacks but that's until you don't watch the same thing simultaneously on an AMOLED screen. As such the videos in HDR10 with adaptive colour display brings out the colors pretty well. So it's fine if you need the performance,the screen is really not of a bad quality.<br>I was worried about the wrong thing all along, The real Con for me was the Software. MIUI 13 or any version per say On REDMI devices &amp; POCO devices are different. I had never used a REDMI phone but i had used a POCO F1 &amp; let me tell you that POCO does change MIUI very much for Users. I had thought REDMI &amp; POCO both use MIUI , so how different can they be. Turns out a lot. There are bugs &amp; bloatwares.<br>I removed the apps which could be uninstalled manually then I removed some system apps to remove bloatwares &amp; unnecessary clutter. Then i tried to modify things as per my customisation preferences which had different hurdles altogether although that only did that much to improve the software. Let's see if an update fixes the bugs &amp; patches everything up.<br>POCO has a much better launcher than REDMI . You'll be surprised that Poco launcher isn't supported on this device even after being a sister company &amp; even after having the same base OS &amp; UI...🙆🏻‍♂️<br>Other launchers go around the functions missing in this phone but then the phone will tell you that gestures aren't supported for them, only the on screen buttons have to be used for navigation..🤷🏻‍♂️<br>For Example : A simple Double tap to Lock Screen is missing..i had to install an app for that. Give it accessibility which has a timer for 10 secs. Then by pass the battery optimisations for it as it would revoke the accessibility. Then make a security exception as it would deem the app a security risk. All this for just this 1 customisation...<br><br>Goodness me. i did more work on the optimisations on this phone than its developers would have...<br>Just kidding..😛<br><br>Last Words : The device is fairly new &amp; there are definitely a few software glitches. I just didn't know the gap was such even between devices running the same Custom UI of Android.<br>All being said, i must say that the device held up to all things wonderfully. It is a performance oriented phone &amp; it does show it. You'll not be disappointed by this device. Everything is above average or better in the device with an exceptional performance for sure. However ,if you get this device software can play spoil sport with you...<br><br>( P.S. - Gaming was excellent too. Only played COD &amp; Asphalt though. Couldn't test BGMI as it got banned from Play Store. I could have side loaded it but didn't get time due to the customisations requirements...)",4.0 out of 5 stars
5615,Bank of your buck,"The phone (6/128) is really good for the price but there as some major problems in the phone (which can be fixed in update)<br><br>Cons:<br>1: Ram management is third class only 1.8-2.5 gb is available but no problem in 8gb/256 variant ,it's something with miui that 6 gb variant has problem in ram management.<br>2. U can't multi task more than 2-3 apps even the lite's apps like fb,Amazon,flipkart,etc u will find that the app is killed ,yeah it's due to ram management problem and happens only for 6gb ram variant.<br>3: front camera is blurry and can't focus on subjects while the back camera is decent for the price.<br>4: Gaming : it actually is a best as it can play most of the game in highest seetings but there a cache for 6gb variant users again which is again due to ram management,games get killed during gameplay for games I play Genshin impact and apex legends though apex only sometimes it force closes but for Genshin its like every play though for 30-40 mins it will force close and it's again due to ram management for 6gb players only .<br><br>Now that's enough talking about problems now it's time for advantages or say good things about this phone.<br><br>Pros:<br>1: u actually enjoy gaming in this phone due to LPDDR5x ram and Ufs 3.1 games like Genshin impact which is a huge 18gb+ game runs smoothly like butterly smooth even in the highest though recommended is to lower to high cuz ram management kills the game in highest too fast and Apex and other game work in smooth-ultra which is op for a 20-25 k phone ,just Miui have to fix ram management for 6gb variant.<br>2.144hz display is buttery smooth and the ffs display is not bad at all  very close to amoled,it supports HDR+ and doulby vison for a nice movie experience .<br>3. The speakers are loud and packs a punch when u play shooting games due to the dual speaks and even the music experience is op as the punchiness is just excellent .<br>4. The x-axis motor is another good stuff in it cuz playing game u feel the game because of it.<br><br>Overall Rating:<br>8/10<br><br>Note for improvement:<br>1: ram management for 6gb variant as it's leading to force close of apps and games<br>2: fix blur in front camera",4.0 out of 5 stars

Not a single frame drop i faced in these days. Haptics are awesome, TSR is awesome, Display is good too. It's an awesome quality FFS LCD panel with dolby vision support to make the display colors more vibrant. The 67W charger charges the phone from 2-100% in 50min-1hr approx.  Although I would say the front camera is not as good as the rear one. It butifies the face too much that sometimes you can't even see the details. The rear camera is good with high dynamic range and soothing colors.<br><br>And for all those BGMI players. Yes the phone supports 90fps in smooth graphics and it maintains around 85-90fps. The battery usage after 2.5hrs of BGMI gameplay at 90fps is 50-55%.<br><br>All those who are talking about ram management issue, I faced that too, but for first 3or4 days. Then the phone adapts my app usage and it manages the ram according to that. I would say give the rom some time to adapt with your usage, then you will find no issue<br><br>Hope this helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I have tasted in heavy ise like online streaming, gaming etc as well , the battery last long like 5-6hr easily.. depending upon the network it may different a little.<br>Took so much of time while Restart the phone.<br>Redmi has always Heating issue, while gaming and video it's some how manage the heat but while charging the phone is getting little bit Heat.<br>*IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A ALLROUNDER PHONE YOU CAN PURCHASE IT*<br>*HOPE MY REVIEW WILL HELP YOU*",4.0 out of 5 stars

5661,Yellow tinted screen 128gb 6gb version.,"Everything is fine but the display is having yellow tint . Please Google about the yellow tint in display. Another thing is  that phone done does not has dedicated proximity sensor it uses A.I  , gyrososcope and accelerometer to make phone screen of during calls. For me except yellow tint in the  everything is fine. Back camera is decent front 16mp is does not take good pictures in less light . Front camera has poor edge detection.<br>Edit- yellow tint has been resolved using options in colour scheme in display section. You can set your own colour tone.<br>Phone also has a awesome screen time just switch off all the vibrations. Giving me 10 hours at 120hz which is a default screen refresh rate. If you watching too many videos that 8:30 hours is at worst case scenario.  At 90 hz it can give more but after using at  120 hz , 90 hz feels like slow. 😅<br>To charge fast , please charge the phone at airplane mode . No wifi , no cellular nothing. It's 44 mins which same at which my poco X3 pro charges which has a bigger battery and has 33 Watt charger, but the thing is k50i get juced up by 50 % in 15 minutes, may be i suppose it has two different kind of batteries 2500 and 2500 like that. Will keep updating",4.0 out of 5 stars
5662,Balanced Performance oriented phone.,"First thing , I would say the real price mark of the phone should be around 20-22k. Over that it's kind of overpriced.<br><br>Performance: Dimensity 8100 is a beast and performs great on all types of workload. Smooth and lag free operation. 8GB of Ram is sufficient enough for multitasking and gaming.<br><br>Camera: Average I'd say. There is no 64MP feeling. More like a average phone type camera. Lossless 2x zoom is good along with EIS in video recording but could have been much better. Night photos really suffer a lot and put out a lot of noise.<br><br>Build: Great , though plastic it feels premium and sturdy.<br><br>Speaker: Dolby Atmos and Stereo Speakers leaves a mesmerizing experience.<br><br>Display: Being a LCD it's awesome and with 144Hz one wouldn't feel any difference with AMOLED. Colour reproduction is very precise.<br><br>Battery: Charges within an hour with provided 67W charger. But drains a little fast; Can expect 6-7 hours of SOT.<br><br>MIUI: Optimised and good. Lots of customisation options available. Ads are not there once properly tuned.<br><br>Major Cons:<br>~ Battery draining a little fast.<br>~ Sometimes Network seems unstable.<br>~ Camera certainly could be better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

5666,Very good phone but...,"&nbsp;Phone is very good. Dimensity 8100 processor in this price range is very good.

Anyways, I got it for Rs. 22k (including offers &amp; card discounts), so no complains about that.",4.0 out of 5 stars
5667,If you're searching for a gaming phone at this price point just go for it,At this price point it's really a beast for gaming... The look is great... Mediatek dimensity 8100 is a very powerful processor... It's great for multitasking and gaming... The battery is just good... The battery life is almost upto 8-10hrs of heavy usage... Well I'm quite disappointed in camera... The camera boosts the color... It doesn't look very realistic... I find the brightness is pretty low in sunlight and it has some serious heating issues... After gaming for 1.30hrs I found it's camera portion was pretty hot... As for conclusion it's definitely a good phone at this price point... At this price point you won't find any better phone for gaming... So as I said if you're finding a gaming phone at a budget price just go for it.,4.0 out of 5 stars

5681,Only for speedsters.,"This phone is really awesome. If you don't compare it to an oled phone, this phone has plenty to offer. The snappy fast app switching or opening feel and the buttery smooth scrolls. This phone has it all. The only category i dont like is, in the camera department, when the phone finds a face in the camera UI it takes really slow and terrible photos. If the subject isnt human, it snaps really fast. If u have kids and want to take photos of em, forget this phone. This is really a pro phone for hardcore gamers as well. The game opening times are really quick. It can run all the games out there. And with really smooth graphics. The battery performance is splendid. The in hand feel, the tall aspect ratio, makes it a delight to hold.",4.0 out of 5 stars

No hanging problem, very long lasting battery and smooth interface. The only problem I found that this android go version does not support Amazon Pay upi. Because Amazon Pay upi never works in any type of android go version. Otherwise, there is nothing to complain. Security is very fine. Dura Speed automatically restricts background apps and data. No junk or suspicious phone calls or messages you receive. Loved one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

5827,great ph at this price.. Lava Make in India,"Pros:<br>1. Stock Android: No useless or unnecessary apps. Core Android uses battery efficiently and without freezes.<br>2. Octa core and Battery is really nice. With YT, Netflix and LIV I watch continuously, it gives me smooth and 1 day+ performance. That's very good for 5000 Mah. That too at this price of INR 6,600.<br>3. Smooth screen for my needs: Videos YT, Netflix, Amazon, etc. arfe clear enough. Can't ask more at this price.<br>4. Type C charges very fast. And the cable is data+ charging mode so extra useful.<br>5. Size: just right for me, not too long like LAVA Z2 MAX I have. But Z2 is another powerhouse.<br><br>Cons: Can't find fault, but one observation on battery.<br>Battery could have been 6000 Mah since the Octa core processor is efficient as I found. Then a higher price could have been justified with the huge battery. 5000 Mah is good for me as my hotspot is not on this device, but for such users or heavy usage, 5000 Mah may not be sufficient.<br>Performance is very good since 2 weeks from my purchase date: Apr 8th",5.0 out of 5 stars

6075,Average,"Purchased this around may end and got it delivered by June 1st week 2021 and I am writing this review on 2nd September 2021. So basically I have used this for 3 months. I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:<br>1) It has started slowing down<br>2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had<br>3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon. It's weight is more than one plus series phones.<br>4) the worst camera quality I have ever seen.<br><br>One can think to buy this for urgent use or for very short term use. I had to buy this when my samsung phone got into a drain and I really needed one asap and during May month all shops were closed for 2nd wave of covid. This phone will definitely show some issue withing few months even if u r a moderate user, not using much social media and not palying any games.",2.0 out of 5 stars

6125,Cheap but clearly at the expense of performance,"You can keep this as a phone you might want to use as a backup in case your phone breaks down all of a sudden.  It might serve a purpose better than having no phone at all. To me, it seems like Redmi is openly saying that for a phone with a price of &lt;7k, a terribly unresponsive interface and graphics lag is what you can overlook, given that the ROM is 32gb while RAM stays still at the 2gb mark. Up to a certain extent, I could agree to this argument, but Redmi 6A, which is a model way older and was sold back in 2018-19 is a much better smartphone in terms of responsiveness. We are not buying a new phone - be it a cheap one - just to find that the call logs screen takes about 2 to 2.5 secs to transit from an older call log screen. And if in between this, you happen to press any of the dialled nos, it would make a call to the unintended contact before you realize that it was an older screen.

Amazing product. Totally worth the price paid for. I've been using the laptop for a month now. Haven't observed any issues so far.

Definitely use a cooling pad if u r a regular heavy user or gamer.",5

It boots up lightening fast and ready to use in just 5-8 seconds. Freaking awesome speed! All the games and apps that i have tried ran smoothly as expected and sometimes beyond expectations.

Battery is too bad for gaming as it's just 51 wt.hr, but for normal use it stands for 4-5 hrs. Display is not so good , it's colour accuracy is so weak. It is good at gaming as I played NFS PAYBACK, GTA 5, NFS HEAT, WITCHER 3, FARCRY 6. Your fingerprint can easily be imprinted on the laptop as it's built design is like that so...

9536,Mind-blowing purchase,"Laptop is perfect. Got Windows 11 update. Screen could have been better at this price range, but its good only. Yes hinges are a bit loose, the screen will fall automatically after 150 deg. Also dedicated graphics card is Radeon Graphics and Not Radeon Vega Graphics, which is expected at this price range. Additional SSD and RAM slots, 2 fans in a notebook (which is great)",5

Overall Value for money laptop , Best for college students, as it fulfills all the purpose , coding can be done smoothly , There is an integrated AMD Radeon graphics, so though it's not a gaming laptop, you can easily play games like Valorant.",5
9538,Excellent,"I got this laptop at 37.5K with various offers
At this price range this is the best laptop one can get
Build quality and performance are top-notch, very lightweight doesn't feel like you are holding a laptop.
If someone is looking for studying or it work with compact, high performance device can go for it.
The only negative I found was display, it's a little yellowish and not that crisp, if you need it for art or graphic design, you should avoid this laptop.",5
9539,Great Value for money,"Pros:
- Good quality display and snappy fast performance.
- The battery optimization and calibration options in ""MSI Center Pro"" software is great.
- Has Wifi 6
- Ram is upgradable and there are two NVMe slots for SSD

Cons:
- Speaker is not loud (but I have headphones so it does not matter)
- Does not come with MS Office Home and Student",5
9540,Best in the market!,"Bought it at 37k on deal. At this price, performance and build are impressive. Display is a bit yellowish, but it can be tuned using AMD Radeon software. Sound is also a bit low, it can be tuned as well using SteelSeries GG Sonar. Overall its an awesome laptop. Totally satisfied with it.",5
9541,Perfect product!,"I bought it while it was in offer. However, even you give the current price (whatever it is now) for it, believe me it's design and performance makes it worth it. The experience is really smooth even if I bought this in September and writing this review in late January. The battery performance decent enough, not too good and not even bad. But, i bet when you buy it you will feel your connection to this more than any device you owned so far. Btw, my average working time on this laptop is 7-8 h...

Thank you Flipkart and MSI for bringing me this budget Range powerful laptop...💕😊😘😘",5
9544,Awesome,"Overall it's a good buy under 50k.If you are looking for a laptop for office work then go for it. Design is top notch it has a metal body on top which gives premium feel.Only cons after using for 1 month is it's sound is not much loud,you definitely need an earphone to enjoy songs & movies.Also hinge issue it will automatically fall after 150°.",5
9545,Value-for-money,"Good product at a very affordable price. Bought it for 43000 in flipkart big billion sales

Component review:

I use it mainly for software development but run a ton of tools simultaneously, so would say that I do use it heavily and this laptop handles the load pretty well.

The fans are pretty quiet even under high loads. There are two fans which keep the machine at a comfortable temprature.

Camera is decent, apt for video calling but nothing special.

Backlight keyboard is nice with 3 leve...

Was almost about to buy an 360 touch laptop for 65k,glad i changed my decision and bought m1 air as this is more value for money.
No complains for normal usage.
If most performance is needed, mbp with 16gb Ram wud be the best, which is 50k more.

4. You will crave for the glowing logo but it's not there.
5. Soldered 256gig SSD.

10706,Waste of money!,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.,1

10953,Pretty good,"Battery backup is very bad as it's dropping 1-2% per each minute for browsing. So the battery backup is only 1 and 30 hours only.

Display is awesome but screen reflicting due to glossy display.

My recommendation is go for non OLED as in future there might be a chance of screen burning in OLED screens.",4

11766,Worthless,"Review after 8 month use
Quite unsatiy
Not recommended

Don't buy , the price range with this type of functions make this laptop lucrative that's why i bought, but actually it's not worth buying.

I am facing a lot of issues with this, like it gives shock while charging (withstandable shock obviously, not high current ) which is irritating , also it goes blank many times after power on , then you need to force boot. Many times after sleep mode it doesn't wake up even after clicking trackpad...

Build quality and performance are top-notch, very lightweight doesn't feel like you are holding a laptop.
If someone is looking for studying or it work with compact, high performance device can go for it.
The only negative I found was display, it's a little yellowish and not that crisp, if you need it for art or graphic design, you should avoid this laptop.",5

- Good quality display and snappy fast performance.
- The battery optimization and calibration options in ""MSI Center Pro"" software is great.
- Has Wifi 6
- Ram is upgradable and there are two NVMe slots for SSD

Cons:
- Speaker is not loud (but I have headphones so it does not matter)
- Does not come with MS Office Home and Student",5

The experience is really smooth even if I bought this in September and writing this review in late January. The battery performance decent enough, not too good and not even bad.

Component review:

I use it mainly for software development but run a ton of tools simultaneously, so would say that I do use it heavily and this laptop handles the load pretty well.

The fans are pretty quiet even under high loads. There are two fans which keep the machine at a comfortable temprature.

12242,Worthless,"Review after 8 month use
Quite unsatiy
Not recommended

Don't buy , the price range with this type of functions make this laptop lucrative that's why i bought, but actually it's not worth buying.

I am facing a lot of issues with this, like it gives shock while charging (withstandable shock obviously, not high current ) which is irritating , also it goes blank many times after power on , then you need to force boot. Many times after sleep mode it doesn't wake up even after clicking trackpad...

- Good quality display and snappy fast performance.

I use it mainly for software development but run a ton of tools simultaneously, so would say that I do use it heavily and this laptop handles the load pretty well.

The fans are pretty quiet even under high loads. There are two fans which keep the machine at a comfortable temprature.

12710,Waste of money!,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop.

Those who are worried about battery they should know that feature rich watches always have lesser battery backup.

1. Battery- 3/5 stars
It gives backup of 25Hrs-30Hrs after moderate usage.
Charging time- 2.5 Hrs
2. Looks- 4.5/5 stars
Watch looks premium. Straps could be better.

Thanks Flipkart for this product 😍😍😍",5
14414,Really Nice,Good investment at this price. I am pretty satisfied with the product. The activities tracker is pretty accurate. The health parameters were accurate with Max difference of +-2. This was bit rare as there is a particular method to obtain secure precised readings and I was able to get those. So in my opinion it's great.,4
14415,Great product,First of all this watch has amazing look.. it's look like as a iPhone watch.. second thing is i got this in sell only at 1709...so it's also nice.. third one is it gives lots of features for activity tracking and almost working good with 95% accuracy..so overall it's great product.. blindly go for it..only one cone in this product is battery draining fast sometimes.. after 4-5 days you have to charge this watch.. otherwise everything is fine..go for it and enjoy 👍🏻👍🏻,5
14416,Wonderful,"After use of 2 months an honest review is here ....1 the design and built is osm
2 . Straps and materials quality is fine enough
3. Display is average
4. Battery life is 7 days in 3 level brightness
5. Activity tracker is not good some times it track heart beat in air and on strap and also on some surfaces like clothes ...
6. Connecting issue occurs sometimes, it tookes too much time and got reset sometime and doesn't even connect for a long while...
Overall in this price range it is fine ...

16441,Brilliant,"It's really good product, build quality is excellent, with long lasting battery life, display brightness is also good in indoor as well as outdoor, and lastly most of activity tracker are nearly accurate.
So, I almost satisfied with this product...!
(I would suggest to buy golden colour with green belt)",5
16442,Decent product,"Well the product looks pretty good and feels premium too......but the main problem comes with the sensors....the spo2 sensor works only sometimes by accident most of the time it doesn't work....step tracker is also not accurate like i walk 10 steps the watch shows 20 to 30 steps hell my phn's step tracker works better than this....all the sport modes are also just present but not practical in any scenarios.....overall the money you pay i.e 2k is worth but more than 2k its just not reasonable....

17693,Classy product,"The product is awesome, totally value for money. The battery only drained 3% even after using the calling feature and all the health tracking features for 1 day.

I have a wrist of 16cm and it looks something like this. Overall great watch with premium quality.",5
17694,Nice product,"The watch is terribly well balanced, the display is amazing however the sensors need better calibration which I believe will be done by future updates, the SPO2 sensor failed to detect my blood oxygen percentage twice and the pedometer counts hand movements frequently, the design is amazing and display is super High Quality but I request more customisation features in custom watch faces, like different clock layout, battery layouts etc",4

Design and build - 5/5 (feels like a flagship watch. Kudos to noise team)
Display - 5/5 it should be the USP of this watch.
UI - 4/5 smooth af but sometimes observed some lags but very rare (assume 1 out of 50 times)
Connectivity - 5/5 no problems faced. Compatibility with NoiseFit app is great
Activity Tracking - 4/5 not as best but decent. You can observe 7-8% of error in values.
Overall - 4.5/5 Highly recommend if you're looking for circular dial watch under 4k...

18933,Perfect product!,"Awesome watch.

Accurate HR, Steps , SpO2

18934,Good quality product,"Starting with the looks of the watch, the watch doesn't look much premium due to its polycarbonate build, but it makes it pretty comfortable for long wears.
The straps and fit of the watch is quite firm, although you might feel the buckle tongue losing its grip pretty soon if you are putting the watch on and off your wrist a little too often, the battery is quite adequate if you are not a heavy user, the built in oxymeter and heart beat monitor are pretty accurate to actual medical devices....

- Has continuous heart beat tracker, but the same is not available for SpO2 and stress levels. Wouldn't recommend for people who wants to monitor their vitals all day lo...

20341,Wonderful,I liked this watch very much it has good looks and good design and I'm impressed with it very good Bluetooth calling feature I liked it very much and it has sports modes and it calculates the spo2 BPM bit accurate and has good display and has accurate notifications overall it is a good and great watch and worth in this price range.,5
20342,Nice,"It doesn't give correct data , like if I have walked for 5 kms it shows only 4 kms , that's quite demoralising , no if step count is also less than it should be, I know that it's showing wrong data as I have other two equipments to measure , as well as I know tacking area length of my apartment.
Disappointed with the product as it's quite costly not worth it.",3

20356,Classy product,"Perfect one in the budget. Bluetooth calling is working perfectly. Lots of watch faces. All the health data are mostly accurate. The watch should be tight on your wrist to get the accurate readings. Otherwise you have to press and hold the watch during measurements. Battery backup is good. The sleep monitor is pretty awesome! We cannot cheat the watch by pretending we are sleeping. It record the exact time when we fall asleep and when we awake. Good build quality.

20359,Terrible product,Awesome deal. So many features and beautiful design at Very reasonable price. Loved the product,1
20360,Highly recommended,"Great watch at the price. All the essential features are available. I don't see any any utility of gps in a watch, it counts steps perfectly so it absolutely sufficient for me to track my fitness records.",5
20361,Worth the money,It was really awesome product. Features are too good. In that price best watch i can recommend. Calling feature was excellent. Loud and clear speaker. Mic clarity was good. Battery backup was 3 days While connecting Bluetooth continuously. I was closely observed on battery backup. It takes 1hr approximately to full battery.,4
20362,Simply awesome,Best looking smart watch with great functionality and all excellent features. Everyone surely asks about the watch. I recommend this to all.,5
20363,Excellent,I really love this smart watch.. its help to to monitor my blood pleasure and while i am in bike to rcvd call any many more...,5
20364,Value-for-money,Screen size little bit more then its goods and screen resolution also little bit improve all others feature good and its value of money overall design good and battery life will explain after 1 week to check. Also watch faces need to improve,4
20365,Does the job,This is just a digital watch with smart appearance. Sleep tracking is improper. Step counter shows too much number. So finally I am not happy with this watch. Specifications are very impressive but doesn't work as such.,3
20366,Good choice,"Pro -
Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price
Have lot of features
Calling available but sometimes when you are traveling it might face issue related to network connectivity
Battery is impressive
Best in this price
Comes with brand realibility

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.
Skin is changed...

20367,Good choice,Decent watch at this price range. The Bluetooth calling works fine. Gives an option of saving upto 8 contacts at a time. Tracking features incl heart rate and SPO 2 are fairly ok. Continuous step tracking is not so reliable.,4
20368,Wonderful,"Posting after using 2 months,so everything is quite good but the most important factor is the battery backup as is not up to the mark I use to charge it daily without using its calling function n media player I can say the battery backup is not that much of good that it should be in actually.",4

20371,Good quality product,"Good watch with all the necessary features and one standout excellent feature of bluetooth calling. display, response, activity tracking are upto the mark, the only con is mobile app is bit sluggish and too much time for uploading contact and downloading watch faces.overall a good product for the price",4
20372,Perfect product!,this is a best watch battery back up is so good stand by time is 30 days .i am impressed,5
20373,Decent product,"As a smartwatch, it is worth your money. Cool display and good activity tracker. After 8 months, watch is not getting charged from the original charger provided by company.",3
20374,Nice product,"Good product. Talking quality is pretty nice. But I don't feel that the steps and other such features are accurate. It's not worth to buy if you are buying it as a fitness watch.



Edit: Stopped working after 3 months but before the issue it was working pretty good.",4
20375,Terrific,Got this yesterday and my kid absolutely loved it. Speaker is really good and display is smooth. Call feature is cool and exciting bit microphone is a bit low quality but does the job to intimate people u r busy or gives us the chance of switching to phone audio. Brilliant for the value for money and I would say would exceed expectations on lot of fronts,5
20376,Fabulous!,The features are definitely good and that makes it a good worth of buying. I liked the design and ease of tracking and using the smartwatch. It looks trendy and cool.,5

Now have given up and realized I have wasted my hard earned money.

20410,Just wow!,I'm fully satisfying with this product. It's also stylish & round shape makes this classy. Calling quality is also is a remarkable in this phone. Sound is remarkably louder than I thaught. Display quality is also good. But it have to handle carefully during heavy rain cause it's not waterproof purely. Plus I can listen songs makes me happy. Backup timing lill disappointing.. But... Over all in this price range it's a great deal.,5

You cant cotrol music volume. and i cant silent the incoming voice call using watch. Build is Sturdy coz of metal casing. And its somehow heavy to wear. You get almost 200 of watchfaces in the app.",4
20414,Worth the money,"Screen is very prone to scratch, Do not remove the pre-applied plastic guard. I highly recommend to apply a tempered glass or rather order a screen guard along with the watch.

Disappointed with the product as it's quite costly not worth it.",3

20476,Classy product,"Perfect one in the budget. Bluetooth calling is working perfectly. Lots of watch faces. All the health data are mostly accurate.

We cannot cheat the watch by pretending we are sleeping. It record the exact time when we fall asleep and when we awake. Good build quality.

20480,Highly recommended,"Great watch at the price. All the essential features are available. I don't see any any utility of gps in a watch, it counts steps perfectly so it absolutely sufficient for me to track my fitness records.",5
20481,Worth the money,It was really awesome product. Features are too good. In that price best watch i can recommend. Calling feature was excellent. Loud and clear speaker. Mic clarity was good. Battery backup was 3 days While connecting Bluetooth continuously. I was closely observed on battery backup. It takes 1hr approximately to full battery.,4
20482,Simply awesome,Best looking smart watch with great functionality and all excellent features. Everyone surely asks about the watch. I recommend this to all.,5
20483,Excellent,I really love this smart watch.. its help to to monitor my blood pleasure and while i am in bike to rcvd call any many more...,5
20484,Value-for-money,Screen size little bit more then its goods and screen resolution also little bit improve all others feature good and its value of money overall design good and battery life will explain after 1 week to check. Also watch faces need to improve,4
20485,Does the job,This is just a digital watch with smart appearance. Sleep tracking is improper. Step counter shows too much number. So finally I am not happy with this watch. Specifications are very impressive but doesn't work as such.,3
20486,Good choice,"Pro -
Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price
Have lot of features
Calling available but sometimes when you are traveling it might face issue related to network connectivity
Battery is impressive
Best in this price
Comes with brand realibility

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.

20487,Good choice,Decent watch at this price range. The Bluetooth calling works fine. Gives an option of saving upto 8 contacts at a time. Tracking features incl heart rate and SPO 2 are fairly ok. Continuous step tracking is not so reliable.,4
20488,Wonderful,"Posting after using 2 months,so everything is quite good but the most important factor is the battery backup as is not up to the mark I use to charge it daily without using its calling function n media player I can say the battery backup is not that much of good that it should be in actually.",4

20494,Nice product,"Good product. Talking quality is pretty nice. But I don't feel that the steps and other such features are accurate. It's not worth to buy if you are buying it as a fitness watch.



Edit: Stopped working after 3 months but before the issue it was working pretty good.",4
20495,Terrific,Got this yesterday and my kid absolutely loved it. Speaker is really good and display is smooth. Call feature is cool and exciting bit microphone is a bit low quality but does the job to intimate people u r busy or gives us the chance of switching to phone audio. Brilliant for the value for money and I would say would exceed expectations on lot of fronts,5

20596,Classy product,"Perfect one in the budget. Bluetooth calling is working perfectly. Lots of watch faces. All the health data are mostly accurate. The watch should be tight on your wrist to get the accurate readings. Otherwise you have to press and hold the watch during measurements. Battery backup is good. The sleep monitor is pretty awesome! We cannot cheat the watch by pretending we are sleeping. It record the exact time when we fall asleep and when we awake. Good build quality.

20599,Terrible product,Awesome deal. So many features and beautiful design at Very reasonable price. Loved the product,1
20600,Highly recommended,"Great watch at the price. All the essential features are available. I don't see any any utility of gps in a watch, it counts steps perfectly so it absolutely sufficient for me to track my fitness records.",5
20601,Worth the money,It was really awesome product. Features are too good. In that price best watch i can recommend. Calling feature was excellent. Loud and clear speaker. Mic clarity was good. Battery backup was 3 days While connecting Bluetooth continuously. I was closely observed on battery backup. It takes 1hr approximately to full battery.,4
20602,Simply awesome,Best looking smart watch with great functionality and all excellent features. Everyone surely asks about the watch. I recommend this to all.,5
20603,Excellent,I really love this smart watch.. its help to to monitor my blood pleasure and while i am in bike to rcvd call any many more...,5
20604,Value-for-money,Screen size little bit more then its goods and screen resolution also little bit improve all others feature good and its value of money overall design good and battery life will explain after 1 week to check. Also watch faces need to improve,4
20605,Does the job,This is just a digital watch with smart appearance. Sleep tracking is improper. Step counter shows too much number. So finally I am not happy with this watch. Specifications are very impressive but doesn't work as such.,3
20606,Good choice,"Pro -
Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price
Have lot of features
Calling available but sometimes when you are traveling it might face issue related to network connectivity
Battery is impressive
Best in this price
Comes with brand realibility

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.
Skin is changed...

20607,Good choice,Decent watch at this price range. The Bluetooth calling works fine. Gives an option of saving upto 8 contacts at a time. Tracking features incl heart rate and SPO 2 are fairly ok. Continuous step tracking is not so reliable.,4
20608,Wonderful,"Posting after using 2 months,so everything is quite good but the most important factor is the battery backup as is not up to the mark I use to charge it daily without using its calling function n media player I can say the battery backup is not that much of good that it should be in actually.",4

20614,Nice product,"Good product. Talking quality is pretty nice. But I don't feel that the steps and other such features are accurate. It's not worth to buy if you are buying it as a fitness watch.



Edit: Stopped working after 3 months but before the issue it was working pretty good.",4
20615,Terrific,Got this yesterday and my kid absolutely loved it. Speaker is really good and display is smooth. Call feature is cool and exciting bit microphone is a bit low quality but does the job to intimate people u r busy or gives us the chance of switching to phone audio. Brilliant for the value for money and I would say would exceed expectations on lot of fronts,5

20716,Classy product,"Perfect one in the budget. Bluetooth calling is working perfectly. Lots of watch faces. All the health data are mostly accurate. The watch should be tight on your wrist to get the accurate readings. Otherwise you have to press and hold the watch during measurements. Battery backup is good. The sleep monitor is pretty awesome! We cannot cheat the watch by pretending we are sleeping. It record the exact time when we fall asleep and when we awake. Good build quality.

20720,Highly recommended,"Great watch at the price. All the essential features are available. I don't see any any utility of gps in a watch, it counts steps perfectly so it absolutely sufficient for me to track my fitness records.",5
20721,Worth the money,It was really awesome product. Features are too good. In that price best watch i can recommend. Calling feature was excellent. Loud and clear speaker. Mic clarity was good. Battery backup was 3 days While connecting Bluetooth continuously. I was closely observed on battery backup. It takes 1hr approximately to full battery.,4
20722,Simply awesome,Best looking smart watch with great functionality and all excellent features. Everyone surely asks about the watch. I recommend this to all.,5

20724,Value-for-money,Screen size little bit more then its goods and screen resolution also little bit improve all others feature good and its value of money overall design good and battery life will explain after 1 week to check. Also watch faces need to improve,4
20725,Does the job,This is just a digital watch with smart appearance. Sleep tracking is improper. Step counter shows too much number. So finally I am not happy with this watch. Specifications are very impressive but doesn't work as such.,3
20726,Good choice,"Pro -
Price if bought under 3000
Good display as per the price
Have lot of features
Calling available but sometimes when you are traveling it might face issue related to network connectivity
Battery is impressive
Best in this price
Comes with brand realibility

Con-
Major con is this only - measurement is less accurate approximately 65% for walking, 90% for bp. Rest can't tell right now. But it is something around 70% accurate so please manually calculate things accordingly.

20727,Good choice,Decent watch at this price range. The Bluetooth calling works fine. Gives an option of saving upto 8 contacts at a time. Tracking features incl heart rate and SPO 2 are fairly ok. Continuous step tracking is not so reliable.,4
20728,Wonderful,"Posting after using 2 months,so everything is quite good but the most important factor is the battery backup as is not up to the mark I use to charge it daily without using its calling function n media player I can say the battery backup is not that much of good that it should be in actually.",4

20734,Nice product,"Good product. Talking quality is pretty nice. But I don't feel that the steps and other such features are accurate. It's not worth to buy if you are buying it as a fitness watch.



Edit: Stopped working after 3 months but before the issue it was working pretty good.",4
20735,Terrific,Got this yesterday and my kid absolutely loved it. Speaker is really good and display is smooth. Call feature is cool and exciting bit microphone is a bit low quality but does the job to intimate people u r busy or gives us the chance of switching to phone audio. Brilliant for the value for money and I would say would exceed expectations on lot of fronts,5

20770,Just wow!,I'm fully satisfying with this product. It's also stylish & round shape makes this classy. Calling quality is also is a remarkable in this phone. Sound is remarkably louder than I thaught. Display quality is also good. But it have to handle carefully during heavy rain cause it's not waterproof purely. Plus I can listen songs makes me happy. Backup timing lill disappointing.. But... Over all in this price range it's a great deal.,5

Design and build - 5/5 (feels like a flagship watch. Kudos to noise team)

I write this review after almost 15days uses.
Pros:
1. Design is very good with flat display.

21919,Value-for-money,Everything about this watch is fine. But it counts steps even if I move the watch in air. Without even wearing it I walked about 41 steps just by moving it in the air. Please fix this if possible through some software updates. Otherwise Heart rate and Oxygen tracking is quite accurate. No complain about model and display. Battery feels quite low yet.. Just received 2 days ago though. Hope company will fix the steps count through some updates,4

Design and build - 5/5 (feels like a flagship watch. Kudos to noise team)
Display - 5/5 it should be the USP of this watch.
UI - 4/5 smooth af but sometimes observed some lags but very rare (assume 1 out of 50 times)
Connectivity - 5/5 no problems faced. Compatibility with NoiseFit app is great
Activity Tracking - 4/5 not as best but decent. You can observe 7-8% of error in values.
Overall - 4.5/5 Highly recommend if you're looking for circular dial watch under 4k...

22399,Value-for-money,Everything about this watch is fine. But it counts steps even if I move the watch in air. Without even wearing it I walked about 41 steps just by moving it in the air. Please fix this if possible through some software updates. Otherwise Heart rate and Oxygen tracking is quite accurate. No complain about model and display. Battery feels quite low yet.. Just received 2 days ago though. Hope company will fix the steps count through some updates,4

That's too disappointed. Every time reconnect calling Bluetooth. But app connected well. I think app and calling Bluetooth are separated. Calling function maybe Bluetooth 3.0 or something. But that's okay.,1

Cons

To connect to a smart watch, the app should be always on otherwise the connection will be lost.
Watch face store doesn't contain good watch faces

24291,Nice product,"My thoughts after 3 days of usage
Overall nice product
Looks premium
Battery life : hardly 4 days
Nice features are provided
But there are too many bugs right now
-Laggy UI
-issues are there with sync and notifications
-Sometimes both sync and notifications are laggy
-Sometimes they don't happen at all
-HR sensor and stress sensors seem good

24294,Wonderful,Product is very good value for money original and main use it has been more than a week battery is very good connect to phone you can comfortably get battery backup up to 7 days but if you do auto heart rate monitoring Its battery backup will hardly last for 2 to 3 days.,4

more options with watch faces (very limited selection) ,
better range ( disconnects very easily ) , message reply option while rejecting a call this is not my first fitness watch and i knw its a budget smartwat...

24297,Nice product,"Excellent smart watch almost this same feature in other brand are priced double i purchased it for just 2250 after ICICI bank credit card discount

24299,Best in the market!,"Once again Noise has delivered a really good product..In this pandemic situation, we all are very much conscious regarding our oxygen saturation and this watch has come out with a satisfactory level to me. I have Checked the precision of spo2 measurements with oximeter and accurate readings every time. Also, the look is trendy and cool.",5
24300,Value-for-money,This is my first smart watch and its design is good but the brightness level is good. Secondly in the Noise Fit app activity fitness level is not good.. slowly added and this noisefit app required too much permission and this app background running battery consumption too high i think need to update .. although is good and stylish watch..no more watch faces and heart rate monitor is accurate . battery backup is good .,4
24301,Simply awesome,Im Pretty Happy about the purchase. All the activity trackers are almost accurate and its pretty class for the budget as well as comfortable to wear. Thats 5 star from Me!!,5
